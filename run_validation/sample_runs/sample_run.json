Although institutional barriers have made it difficult for the United States to ratify international climate agreements and pass domestic legislation, climate advocates also view weak public support as a problem.  To that end, activists have sought to re-frame the issue to be more appealing to the American electorate, which might in turn push lawmakers to take heed.  What kinds of appeals does the U.S. public find persuasive on climate change?  In surveys of Americans, climate change is an important environmental concern, but environmental concerns rank lower than issues such as national security and the economy.  Advocates of climate change policies must confront the challenge that the public historically has viewed climate change as physically and temporally remote.  A high-profile political event such as the Copenhagen climate negotiations or a weather-related catastrophe such as Hurricane Sandy catches attention and puts climate change on the political agenda.  But attitudes about the causes of climate change and the appropriate level of government response are affected by one’s sense of personal risk (see Leiserowitz here, here and here).\n",

Throughout the 2000s, advocates experimented with a variety of frames to garner public support.  The original frame of climate change as an environmental crisis focused on the effects on future generations and humankind.  Such an appeal for transnational and intertemporal altruism is largely a moral claim.  Indeed, some activists made this appeal through efforts such as the “What Would Jesus Drive?” campaign, an effort to link Christianity to environmental stewardship.  In contrast, the green jobs orientation of the early 2000s, that then went on to infuse the rhetoric of the Obama administration, is a primarily material interest-based logic.  In the late 2000s, advocates also sought to tie climate change to national security.  Which of these various approaches is most likely to be successful?  In an article (open access) recently published in Research and Politics, we evaluated climate change frames with a survey experiment.\n",

After reading a mock ad from an environmental organization, participants were then asked questions about their willingness to support advocacy efforts, including writing a letter to Congress, signing a petition and joining an organization.   Knowledge Given the issue’s complexity, people may not be especially well-informed.  We therefore expect that knowledge moderates the effect of persuasive messages on climate change and that more knowledgeable subjects are more likely to respond to a persuasive message.  We measure knowledge about climate change with three questions: 82 percent answered this correctly.  39 percent answered this correctly 22 percent answered this correctly Findings There was no main effect for the experimental manipulation on any of the behaviors, but the interaction between knowledge and experimental condition yielded significant effects for willingness to talk about climate change (F=3.51, p For low-knowledge participants, persuasive messages were either ineffective or demobilizing.\n",

When I look at the 1918 flu, you know, that's what we tend to study, and then we're studying the activities of countries around the world.  One thing is clear, that we did not have the public health infrastructure to respond effectively to this.  The reason why I don't want to jump there is because we don't have the evidence.

What is energy security?  For decades, presidents and pundits have talked about the importance of energy security as a vital national goal.  But very few bother to define what the term really means and what achieving it would actually entail.  That’s because energy security is complicated, and multi-dimensional.  It goes beyond over-simplified notions of energy self-sufficiency or energy independence.  It’s about where our energy comes from, but it’s also about the cost, reliability, sustainability, and scale of our energy use.  Technical, economic, geopolitical and other factors all play a role, and one needs to understand how they interact.  We’ll take a critical look at practical definitions of energy security and how they inform actions and strategies to enhance America’s energy security—now and into the future.  We’ll focus in particular on oil, given both its unique role in our economy and the fact that the United States still imports large amounts of oil despite the recent boom in domestic production.\n",

Even if emissions are stabilized relatively soon, global warming and its effects should last many years, and adaptation would be necessary to the resulting changes in climate.  Adaptation is especially important in developing countries since those countries are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global warming.  That is, the capacity and potential for humans to adapt (called adaptive capacity) is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt.  Furthermore, the degree of adaptation correlates to the situational focus on environmental issues.  Therefore, adaptation requires the situational assessment of sensitivity and vulnerability to environmental impacts.   Adaptive capacity is closely linked to social and economic development.  The economic costs of adaptation to climate change are likely to cost billions of dollars annually for the next several decades, though the amount of money needed is unknown.  Donor countries promised an annual $100 billion by 2020 through the Green Climate Fund for developing countries to adapt to climate change.\n",

The adaptation challenge grows with the magnitude and the rate of climate change.   Another response to climate change is known as climate change mitigation.  It advocates to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or enhance the removal of these gases from the atmosphere (through carbon sinks).  Even the most effective reductions in emissions, however, would not prevent further climate change impacts, making the need for adaptation unavoidable.  A study has concluded, with very high confidence, that in the absence of mitigation efforts, the effects of climate change would reach such a magnitude as to make adaptation impossible for some natural ecosystems.  Others are concerned that climate adaptation programs might interfere with the existing development programs and thus lead to unintended consequences for vulnerable groups.  For human systems, the economic and social costs of unmitigated climate change would be very high.   Section::::Effects of global warming.   The projected effects for the environment and for civilization are numerous and varied.  The main effect is an increasing global average temperature.

But less than two years later, then-president Donald Trump put that future in jeopardy by announcing his plan to withdraw the United States from the accord—a step that became official on November 4, 2020 —as part of a larger effort to dismantle decades of U.S. environmental policy.\n",

Following President Biden’s day one executive order, the United States officially rejoined the landmark Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021, positioning the country to once again be part of the global climate solution.  Meanwhile, city, state, business, and civic leaders across the country and around the world have been ramping up efforts to drive the clean energy advances needed to meet the goals of the agreement and put the brakes on dangerous climate change.  Here’s a look at what the Paris Agreement does, how it works, and why it’s so critical to our future.  Protesters gather near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France during the 2015 UN Climate Conference.  Clement Martin/Sipa USA via Associated Press What Is the Paris Agreement?  The Paris Agreement is a landmark international accord that was adopted by nearly every nation in 2015 to address climate change and its negative impacts.  The agreement aims to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, while pursuing the means to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees.\n",

Presidencia de la Republica Mexicana via Flickr History of the Paris Agreement Hammered out over two weeks in Paris during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) 21st  Conference of the Parties (COP 21) and adopted on December 12, 2015, the Paris Agreement marked a historic turning point for global climate action, as world leaders came to a consensus on an accord comprised of commitments by 195 nations to combat climate change and adapt to its impacts.  President Obama was able to formally enter the United States into the agreement under international law through executive authority, since it imposed no new legal obligations on the country.  The United States has a number of tools already on the books, under laws already passed by Congress, to cut carbon pollution.  The country formally joined the agreement in September 2016 after submitting its proposal for participation.\n",

Separately, Biden proposes a 10 percent tax credit to encourage more manufacturing jobs in the U.S., alongside a 10 percent tax penalty for profits in some businesses, like call centers, that operate overseas but profit off sales in the U.S. To address income inequality, he supports a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour and a “pro-growth, progressive tax code”that closes loopholes benefiting shareholders over laborers.\n",

Education: Free public college.  Universal Pre-K. The former vice president was one of the first Democrats in recent years to advocate for free extended public education.  In his speech announcing that he would not run for president in 2016, Biden called for 16 years of free public education, including community college and four-year public colleges.  He has also backed universal pre-Kindergarten, paid for by closing some loopholes in the tax code.  As a senator in the 1970s, he fought against busing children to schools outside their districts to promote desegregation of public schools.  In 2019, facing criticism, he explained that position this way: “I don’t believe a child should have to get on a bus to attend a good school.  There should be first-rate schools of quality in every neighborhood of this nation, especially in 2019 America.”  Guns: Ban assault weapons.  Universal background checks.

Joe Biden knows there is no greater challenge facing our country and our world.  That’s why he is outlining a bold plan – a Clean Energy Revolution – to address this grave threat and lead the world in addressing the climate emergency.  Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.  It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.  If we can harness all of our energy and talents, and unmatchable American innovation, we can turn this threat into an opportunity to revitalize the U.S. energy sector and boost growth economy-wide.  We can create new industries that reinvigorate our manufacturing and create high-quality, middle-class jobs in cities and towns across the United States.  We can lead America to become the world’s clean energy superpower.\n",

Introduction Like most people going through a divorce, chances are high that you will participate in a Resolution Management Conference.  A Resolution Management Conference takes place at court and is before the judge over your case.  People are often terrified of going to court and want to know what to expect.  In this article, I will cover what a Resolution Management Conference is, how it gets set, what you need to do beforehand, and what will happen at the Conference.  What is a a Resolution Management Conference?  First, let’s get the lingo down.  A Resolution Management Conference is commonly referred to as an “RMC.”  So, if you hear lawyers or judges use the term RMC, they’re most likely referring to a Resolution Management Conference.  A Resolution Management Conference is essentially what the name implies.  It’s a conference where the parties and lawyers go before the judge and try to resolve issues in the case and implement some actions to help manage the case.  The first part of Rule 76, ARFLP helps a little to explain the purpose of an RMC, which is “to facilitate agreements between the parties.”\n",

I’ll go into more detail a little later about exactly what gets done at an RMC, but for now, it’s good to also understand that an RMC is not a trial, it’s not a hearing, and the court cannot enter substantive orders unless both parties agree.  As an example, the court cannot enter a parenting time order or temporary child support order at an RMC unless both parties agree to those orders.  I think it’s important to understand this aspect of an RMC to (1) calm your nerves, and (2) set your expectations as to what will and will not happen at the RMC.  Almost all of the time, an RMC will be in person.  So you will actually have to go down to court and be in the courtroom before the judge for the RMC.  Ok, that’s the basic gist, now let’s talk about how an RMC gets set up.  Setting a Resolution Management Conference In most cases, a Resolution Management Conference (RMC) will be set for one of three reasons.  (1)\n",

This can happen if there is a time period where nothing is filed with the court after the divorce petition and response have been filed.  This allows the court to get the parties together, come before the judge, and figure out what is at issue in the divorce.  (2)  One of the parties filed to have an RMC set.  This can happen if one of the parties wants to keep the ball rolling and get the case to continue moving forward toward a final resolution.  Under Rule 76, the court will have to set an RMC within 60 days of a party filing a request for an RMC.  (3)  One of the parties has filed for temporary orders.  So, there were a lot of rule changes that happened beginning this year, and one of those has to do with temporary orders.  It used to be that once a party filed a motion for temporary orders, the court had to hold a hearing, or some type of conference within 30 days.  More times than not, the court would schedule a return hearing or possibly an RMC to meet that requirement and then scheduled a temporary orders hearing at that time, which would often be another 30 days out or so.\n",

You buy something from a store and charge it to your card, then pay it off at a later time.  But on the other hand, credit allows the possibility for a lot of good, if used responsibly.  For example, paying off college loans, or a dream car.  However this is also how many people go into debt.  It is when you go over that credit is when problems start to arise.  This is where we get into carbon credits, as well as the problems and benefits that surround them.  Carbon Credits First off before getting into all of the details of carbon credits, a lot of people probably have no idea what carbon credits even are.  Basically, carbon credits a tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas equivalent.  One carbon credit equals one tonne of carbon dioxide or, again, another greenhouse gas equivalent.\n",

Insert Image How it is supposed to work is fairly simple.  Each company, or nation, will receive a set of quota credits.  The amount they get depends on the size of their company and what they do.  Every year they get a new set of credits, which they can use up throughout the year.  However, going over the credits given will result in a very harsh penalty.  By giving companies essentially an allowance of carbon that they are allowed to emit, it should force the companies to better regulate their output of emissions and how much energy they use.  These carbon credits were put into effect by the Kyoto protocol which turned carbon emissions into a market system.  It works by giving the companies the option to sell the carbon credits that they do not use to other companies.  If they go over their carbon allowance, they simply buy more from a company who is not using them, or sell them.  However, many issues and controversy have risen from this protocol claiming that since there is the market, there is no real incentive for companies to stay only with their allotted emission cap.\n",

                            "text": "\nHow Carbon Credits Work Large companies, governments and other entities are required by law to purchase carbon credits so they can emit greenhouse gases. The market system of carbon offsets is based on the cap and trade principle.  Basically, it sets a limit on the amount of pollution an entity is allowed to emit within the period of time.  If the company or organization stays under their credit limit, they can sell the credits they did not use to other persons.  On the other hand, if the company exceeds their allowance, they will need to purchase additional carbon credits.  Where does the money go when companies buy or sell these carbon credits?  Well, it goes to fund carbon offset projects.  These projects aim to absorb or eliminate the amount of carbon dioxide gas that is equal to the amount being emitted.  When companies buy credits from offset providers, the money is used for specific projects like planting forests which can absorb carbon naturally, or diverting methane gas from livestock farms for conversion into electricity at a power plant.  Other carbon offsets come in the form of renewable energy, which are called renewable energy credits.  These support green energy sources like wind and solar power.\n",

Let’s make a pact today.  You and me.  From now on, when we have a beauty issue, we’ll look in the cabinets – first – before we run out and buy an expensive (or even bargain) product to fix us.  And, I know, I know … there’s just something a little bit comforting about picking up a bottle of FancySchmancy-Make-You-Fabulous Potion; there’s some weird satisfaction in forking over your hard-earned money to feel hot.  But there’s a new and better feeling from fixing it yourself — by rummaging through your kitchen.  (Put down the donuts.  They do not belong on your hair.)\n",

After shampooing, rinse with the baking soda water and then condition as you normally do.  Or, if you have a way to keep your baking soda dry as you shower, put your shampoo in your hand (as usual) and then sprinkle a decent amount of baking soda on top of that.  Then just wash your hair.  The baking soda will REALLY help clarify your hair and leave it shiny and silky – kinda like it’s brand new.  Who Should Use This:It’s okay for any hair type (especially if you only do it once a week), but it’s best served for people who have issues with hard water or product build-up, dull hair, or hair that just hangs out and doesn’t have much lifeto it.  Like Fiance’s friend James.  2.  Eggs Condition, strengthen, and moisturize with an egg.  Why did the girl with dry hair cross the road?  To follow the chicken laying the eggs.

However, to treat severe eczema it is recommended you visit your GP to get a formula which contains steroids.  The cream will make an eczema flare up shorter and much more bearable.  There are different strengths of steroid cream depending on the severity of eczema you’re trying to treat, so it’s important to check it with your baby’s doctor first.  In both cases, check out the above selection of both prevention and treatment creams.  How to prevent baby eczema breakout Avoid bathing your baby too often - this can strip your baby's skin of protective oils and dry it out further.  Be careful when towel-drying the skin as this can dry the skin out further.  Pat your baby's skin dry rather than rubbing it.  Use bath oil to keep your baby's skin moisturised.  Make sure the water is lukewarm rather than hot.  Use a baby eczema prevention cream to keep the skin moisturised and hydrated.\n",

As I’ve gotten older, though, I have new concerns.  I want to use some sort of moisturizer to prevent age lines and wrinkles.  While my homemade hyaluronic acid serum does seem to work quite well to help my skin stay youthful, I wanted to make myself a moisturizer to use with my serum.  Why make your own moisturizer?  Making your own moisturizer may sound intimidating, but it’s actually very easy.  If you can bake a cake or make aioli, you should have no issues making your own lotions and moisturizers.  Of course, just because you can do something, doesn’t always mean you should.  In this case, though, there are many benefits to making your own facial moisturizer.

Some people may have sensitivities to certain oils.  Being able to customize a moisturizer to suit your needs can be life-changing for people with sensitive skin.  It’s not just about the oils, though.  You can also avoid perfumes, parabens, and other problematic ingredients.  Save money Not only do you gain the ability to choose what goes into your moisturizer, but you can also save money.  Moisturizers tend to be quite expensive despite the fact that normally over 50% of the product is water!  Once you’ve invested in a good emulsifier and preservative, you can use it for multiple batches of moisturizers and other products.  Ingredients A moisturizer has 4 basic ingredients: oils, water, and emulsifier, and a preservative.  I have decided to use a variety of oils to add a variety of skin benefits to this moisturizer.  That said, you could simplify the recipe, using only one or two of the oils that I have used.  I have also added rose water as part of the water phase of the recipe for its lovely fragrance and its skin-soothing properties.  Feel free to only use water, though.\n",

That means like most gaming PCs, the RedMagic 5S is packed full of high-end specs, unique gaming features, and a design that is unlike many of your mainstream smartphones.  DESIGN When you first see the RedMagic 5S from the front, it looks like an ordinary smartphone.  It has a very large 6.65″ display with very small bezels and the only thing that stands out is how large the phone is.

The rear is made of Gorilla Glass, though it has a frosted look that also feels a bit weird in your hands.  Weird in a good way as it does feel like there’s more grip than standard shiny glass and it actually feels really smooth and soft, if that makes any sense.  Straight down the middle of the glass, you’ll find this mirror like strip down the center where the three cameras sit along with a RedMagic Ag cooling plate which seems to be made of silver.  It’s a pretty nice look that gives it some flash.  The borders of the RedMagic 5S is also were you’ll find a lot of interesting features and differences from your standard smartphone.  It’s made of aluminum, which I assume helps with the cooling of all its internal components, and has a matte finish to it.  On the top, you’ll find a mic and an audio jack.\n",

Surprising enough, there is no expandable memory option here.  Lastly, let’s talk about the front of the RedMagic 5S. Like I said at the beginning, there’s nothing really distinguishable about it.  There’s a bezel up top that houses the camera and some sensors and a small bezel at the bottom.  There’s also one front facing speaker on the top which is part of the dual speaker stereo system.  The display here also features an under-glass fingerprint reader.  SPECS As a pure gaming phone, you expect the RedMagic 5S to have incredible, over the top specs, and it does for the most part.\n",

Our list suggests several cheap Android phones that are perfect for people on a budget.  You don’t need to sign a 2-year contract or spend $800+ for a good experience, so here are some affordable phones we can comfortably recommend.  With expensive phones like the Galaxy Note 10 and Pixel 4 XL heavily advertised sometimes buyers forget about cheaper options.  If you haven’t been paying attention you won’t know what’s good or what to buy.  Plus, it’s pretty hard to get under $200 and still be happy with your choice.  That’s where we come in and show you the cheaper side of Android.  Finding a great Android phone is really easy, but finding a good phone that’s also cheap, isn’t.  There are dozens of cheap budget smartphones with awful screens, poor performance, outdated software, and terrible battery life.  That’s what we want to help you avoid.  Motorola continues to lead the market with some of the best price/performance phones, but so does Nokia and a few other brands.\n",

Samsung Galaxy A20 Buy it Now on Amazon for $150 For years Motorola dominated the budget Android phone market, but lately, Samsung has started offering great phones that deliver high-end looks at a wallet-friendly price.  Perhaps the best phone on this list is the Samsung Galaxy A20, which came out near the end of the summer in 2019.  The first thing you’ll notice is the big, beautiful 6.4-inch HD AMOLED display.  This phone packs a decent punch, has dual rear 13+5MP cameras, and a tiny little notch on the front that’s even smaller than the iPhone’s.  If you watch a lot of movies or play games, this is a great option.  Not to mention the 4,000 mAh battery inside so you can game for hours or the expandable storage for all your movies and music.\n",

Some models only work on GSM (AT&T or T-Mobile) while others work everywhere.  2  .  Moto G7 Buy it Now on Amazon for $130 or from Motorola Whenever you need a budget phone you should instantly check out the latest from the Moto G lineup.  For years the Moto G has been one of the most popular budget Android phones.  Right now, that’s the Moto G7, G7 Play, or G7 Power.  Initially, the main Moto G7 came in for $249, but now you can find it for under $200 which makes it perfect for this list.  Along with the low price and a decent screen is amazing software.  You get clean stock Android, somewhat fast updates, and some neat software add-ons that Motorola owners always seem to enjoy.  My favorite is Moto Actions — where you can twist the phone quickly in your hand to launch the camera or swing it like an axe to fire up the camera.  These are actually useful day-to-day and work even if the screen is off.\n",

Most of us default to carriers for a two-year payment plan, but that is usually not the most cost-effective option.  It’s likely that a carrier’s phone pricing is not the best deal, and not to mention the hassle of being locked in for two years or equipment fees that you can be charged.  If you have a bit more money to spend on your phone, check out the iPhone 11 Pro, for a smartphone that won’t disappoint.  That said, purchasing a phone at full price (so you can unlock it) doesn’t necessarily mean it has to cost upwards of $700.  There are some great bargains out there that can closely rival those top-end flagships.  So we went out and did the research so you don’t have to.\n",

The former uses six processors while the latter features eight processors.  Motorola’s top-shelf phones like Moto G6 and Moto G7 also feature eight processors.  Moto X packs only two cores but compensates this with surpassing value for money.  Read a more detailed review in this LG G4 vs. Moto X guide.  While LG has developed a trend of producing phones with multiple cores, Motorola invests its resources elsewhere.  It knows you don’t need a phone with eight cores to read emails or scroll through social media.  As such, the Lenovo-owned manufacturer focuses its resources on producing phones with stellar cameras, decent storage capacity, and light weights.  Screen Resolution Winner: LG There is no area LG ranks better than in manufacturing screens.  It’s an award-winning TV manufacturer, expertise it has invoked in its smartphones.

However, I still prefer the Galaxy A50's picture because the white balance was more accurate.  Unlike the Moto G7 though, the A50 cannot shoot 4K video.  Instead, it shoots 1080p video, and videos in that resolution were on par with the Moto G7.\n",

Galaxy A50 vs. Moto G7's battery and performance For our benchmark tests, the Galaxy A50 consistently edged out the Moto G7.  But in real life, you won't notice a big speed difference between the two, and my day-to-day experience with both are relatively smooth.  There are times though that I run into the occasional hiccup with the Galaxy A50.  For instance, apps unexpectedly quit sometimes or just won't launch.  And the fingerprint reader will take a beat or two longer than usual to unlock the phone.  Again, the majority of the time the Galaxy A50 runs fine, but because its processor isn't top-of-the-line, you may notice the same stutters that I do.\n",

During lab tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode, the phone lasted an average of over 17 hours and 17 minutes.  The Moto G7 lasted only 12 hours and 51 minutes.  One thing to note is that both phones employ one speaker at the bottom for audio.  Their audio quality obviously doesn't compare to that of higher-end phones, but I did notice that audio coming out of the Moto G7 was notably louder and broader compared to the Galaxy A50.  In contrast, the sound from Samsung's phone was not as good and sounded sharper and tinnier.

Usually, you only pay for the looks, reliability, and brand with Apple.  Meaning that you pay more because it’s branded.  Features: Both have pretty amazing features, but again the winner is Samsung.  Apples new Face ID is pretty cool and it’s taken them a long time to develop so it better be perfected right?

A simple way of using a smartwatch is to find its compatibility with the device and then connect it with your Android or iOS phone to start using the features.  Most smartwatches also offer health features such as tracking heart rate and activity tracking (calories burned, steps, distance, active minutes, floors climbed, sleep stages, and swim).  Smartwatches with health and fitness tracking are great for fitness enthusiasts.\n",

Having said that, watching videos and playing games on the iPhone 6 has a great experience compared to the iPhone SE.  The performance is rock solid on the iPhone SE, but the experience is different.  The camera on the iPhone SE is 12MP, but the iPhone 6’s 8MP doesn't fall far behind.  To a naked eye, the difference is barely noticeable.  The single advantage with the iPhone SE is that it has the ability to shoot live photos, 4K video, and Slo-Mo at 240fps.  The front facing Retina Flash is an enhancement with the iPhone SE, but camera performance is nearly identical.\n",

Each side thinks the other has made the wrong choice.  But petty arguments aside, there are some pretty good reasons to consider each mobile operating system, which means despite what some Android devotees may think, there are some solid reasons to buy an iPhone.  There are also some not-so-great reasons.  And some people do choose the iPhone because they fall for some outdated myths about iOS, or because they make erroneous assumptions about how Apple’s operating system compares to Google’s.  Nevertheless, there are a lot of reasons why people choose a phone from Apple over a device from one of the many manufacturers creating Android phones.

When she finds THAT guy, all of a sudden, that’s when we may discover that we’ve got ourselves a cheating girlfriend.  Why does a girl cheat on her boyfriend?  She’s basically trying to make up for the lost excitement that she used to feel for her boyfriend, by seeing someone new.

Starting a new workout routine takes dedication, patience, and a little know-how.  You also need to know what kinds of exercise best suit your goals.  Many health experts recommend a mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercise.  Aerobic exercise includes activities like walking or biking.  Anaerobic exercise includes strength training activities like weight lifting.  Knowing how these types of exercise affect your body can help you create a workout routine that’s just right for you.  What are aerobic and anaerobic exercise?  “Aerobic” means “needs oxygen.”  Aerobic exercise uses a steady supply of oxygen during exercise, while burning both fat and carbohydrates for energy.  It gets your heart rate up for longer periods of time.  That’s why it’s commonly called “cardio.”  Weight lifting and similar strength training activities are examples of anaerobic exercise.  Anaerobic exercise involves a short burst of intense movement, while only burning carbohydrates for energy.  It does not require oxygen.  What counts as exercise?\n",

Most team sports, such as tennis, soccer, and basketball, are also good aerobic activities.  Anaerobic exercise includes strengthening activities and short, intense workouts.  For example, you can lift free weights, use weight machines, or use resistance bands.  You can even use your own body weight for resistance in activities such as push-ups, lunges, and crunches.  Short sprints and plyometric exercises that last a short time are also anaerobic exercises.  What do these types of exercise do?  Aerobic exercise helps boost your overall fitness by conditioning your heart and lungs.  Your heart is the most important muscle in your body, and it needs regular workouts to stay healthy.  Regular aerobic exercise can also reduce your risk of many serious conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.  It can support weight loss and weight management too.  Anaerobic strength training can increase your overall strength, tone your muscles, and boost your bone density.  You can use it to strengthen all your major muscle groups, including your legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms.  It can also help you lose weight: you burn more calories through everyday activities when you have more muscle mass.\n",

It supports your circulatory and respiratory systems and keeps your body running smoothly.  Use strength training exercise to strengthen specific parts of your body, such as your legs, abs, back, or arms.  You can’t cut fat from specific body parts by targeting them with strength training.  But you can increase your strength and muscle tone.  Strength training is crucial to help minimize the loss of lean body mass seen with aging.  How long should my workout be?  When it comes to aerobic exercise, think FITT: frequency, intensity, type, and time.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  Trusted Source recommends getting the equivalent of 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise a day, five days a week.  Or 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise, three days a week.  The CDC Trusted Source also recommends doing muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week.  A single set of 12 repetitions for each muscle group may be enough to maintain your strength.  You can increase the number of sets to increase your muscle mass.  It’s important to allow your body time to recover between workouts, by resting a day or two between strength training sessions.\n",

Not necessarily to run fast, but to run for hours and move consistently through the mountains, valleys, ad meadows.  A 50k race (31 miles) is a great challenge, and is the perfect place to start your ultra-running journey.  It’s a big accomplishment, but it’s also attainable.  Yes, it’s hard–but also yes, it’s important–to train and prepare your body with consistency and dedication when training for your first 50k.  The more that you want to enjoy the 50k itself, the more well-prepared and consistent you need to be in your training.  Approaching a 50k incrementally is the best, most logical way to prepare.  For example: having a few progressively longer test runs before the race itself is key to being in tune with our fitness and solidifying our confidence.  We’ll talk more in-depth about this later in this guide.  Now, the most important question: are you thinking about running a 50k, or are you committed to it?  It’s important to respect the distance, and this means respecting your body by preparing it correctly for such a big challenge.\n",

Now how can you run that far?  that’s what we answer on this article.  The first step: define your motivation – why do you want to run your first ultramarathon?  What’s driving you to take on the 50k distance?  Everyone has their own drive as to why they decide to train for an ultramarathon.  Maybe you’ve run a marathon before?  Or another trail race?  Maybe the openness of the ultrarunning world is appealing to you?  Maybe you want to test yourself and see what you’re capable of doing?  The first step to running your first (or next) 50k is identifying the “why.”  First, you have to put your finger on what’s driving you–find that strong reason, and always keep it in sight as your source of motivation.\n",

In 4-minutes you can burn a ton of calories with this workout!  Although you can do this with a lot of different exercises, I like to do Tabata Air Squats at home the best because you don’t need any equipment, and it is an easy exercise to learn that people can do without hurting themselves.  2  .  Every Minute on the Minute (E.M.O.M) Push-Ups Every Minute on the Minute workouts are another great home workout.  However, I like to do this workout with pushups when I’m at home.  The concept is easy, you pick a number of “reps” you want to do, and the amount of time.  For example, you might do 10-pushups “Every Minute, on the Minute” for 10-minutes, so you will do a total of 100 pushups in 10 minutes.

Read on and I will show you how.  Do a search on the internet for \"the best way to increase your vertical jump\" and your query will bring up thousands of bogus routines and gimmicks - everything from jumping off boxes (plyometrics) to wearing extra thick-soled shoes to stretch your Achilles tendons and all of it is just pure crap!  None of that stuff is going to work and most of it will probably injure you and may even destroy your knee joints.  Also, if you try to increase your vertical jump by simply doing a great deal of jumping, you will most definitely destroy your knees as nothing is more stressful on the joints.

This exercise is very simple and can be done anywhere and anytime at your convenience.  Instructions: Just slip on your sneakers and stand straight with your feet shoulder-width apart, facing forward and opening up your chest.  Now, pull your knees up and slowly land on the balls of your feet - to get your pumping, try lifting your knees higher, ensuring that your thighs are parallel with the ground.  Repeat until the set is complete.  Tip As with any other exercise, warm up your body before jogging or running in place to increase your heart rate gradually.  Also, cool down the body after the workout.  Stretch your thigh, hamstring, hip and calf muscles.  As you begin this exercise, jog in place at a moderate pace for 2-3 minutes, then increase your speed for 90 seconds, and then walk in place for 30 seconds to cool down the body after the exercise.\n",

Rabbits make wonderful pets, and they absolutely love to eat.  Most people love adorable, fluffy rabbits, but there does come a point where a rabbit is too fluffy- when their bulk is not fur, but fat.  Obesity is a common problem for house rabbits, and it often results from their owners not knowing what to feed them or if they are not getting enough exercise.  Rabbits have very delicate digestive systems, and it is vitally important that they maintain a healthy weight and enjoy a balanced, rabbit-safe diet.\n",

Fat rabbits are often lethargic, and are susceptible to heart, liver, and kidney disease.  They may suffer from chronic diarrhea, heat stress in hot weather, splayed legs, and arthritis in later years.  Obesity can also cause breeding and birthing difficulties.\n\n\n{\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/d5\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/d5\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-2.jpg\\/aid4477986-v4-728px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"License: Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} 2 Make sure your rabbit's weight is really indicative of a problem. Some breeds of rabbit are larger than others, but overall size doesn't indicate a weight problem.  {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5f\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5f\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-3.jpg\\/aid4477986-v4-728px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"License: Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} 3 Acknowledge the obvious signs of obesity.  If your rabbit obviously has huge rolls of fat and you can't see his feet when he walks, he's probably overweight.\n\n\nHowever, don't be alarmed if your rabbit has a pocket of fat under its chin. This is called a dewlap.  They are very common in females, but males may have them too.  Check to see that your rabbit is generally pear-shaped; his head should be smaller than his body, which should be narrow and widen out around his hips when he is sitting down.  If your rabbit resembles more of a squishy round blob when he's sitting, he is definitely overweight.  There should also be a smooth upward curve between the rabbit's hips and shoulder.  Feel for the rabbit's spine.  If you can feel it easily, your rabbit is too thin.  If you can feel it after pressing a little (gently), your rabbit is healthy.  If you can't feel it at all, your rabbit is overweight.\n\n\n{\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f5\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f5\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-4.jpg\\/aid4477986-v4-728px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"License: Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} 4 Weigh your rabbit on a scale. If you think you may need to be concerned about your rabbit's health, weigh your rabbit and make sure its weight is in a healthy range for its breed.  This may be difficult to do at home, so it might be best to take your rabbit to the vet to be weighed.\n\n\n{\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/07\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-5.jpg\\/v4-460px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-5.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/07\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-5.jpg\\/aid4477986-v4-728px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-5.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"License: Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} 5 Examine your rabbit's diet to determine what might be causing the dangerous weight gain and adjust accordingly. A healthy adult rabbit's diet should consist of unlimited timothy hay and a reasonable amount of leafy green vegetables.  If your rabbit is under a year old, they should be given alfalfa hay, which is high in protein, but it is important that they transition to timothy hay when they're older.  Common owner mistakes that contribute to rabbit obesity include over-feeding of pellets, over-feeding of treats, and poor choices of vegetables.  Despite contrary belief, pellets should not make up the majority of a rabbit's diet; in fact, some rabbits are just fine without them.\n\n\nIf you want to include pellets in your rabbit's diet, make sure to buy timothy-based pellets with 18 to 20 percent fiber and between 14 percent and 16 percent protein. Don't buy pellets that claim to have dried vegetables or other additions, as they are unnecessary and often contribute to weight gain.  Also, keep in mind that an adult rabbit only needs 1/4 cup of pellet feed per day per 5 pounds of body weight.  Make sure you aren't feeding your rabbit too many treats.  It's fun to watch rabbits eat fruits and other treats, but those should only be given in moderation.  Rabbits should only eat around 2 ounces of fruit per day per ounce of body weight.  {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a4\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-460px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a4\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-6.jpg\\/aid4477986-v4-728px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"License: Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} 6 Give your overweight rabbit an opportunity to exercise.\n\n\nIf your house has been thoroughly rabbit-proofed, let your rabbit run around a room or the whole house for at least a couple of hours every day. If that isn't practical, buy an indoor dog pen and let them run around in there.  Be sure to provide them with toys (or another rabbit, if the two are bonded) to inspire them to play.

What should I do?\n\n\nI also can't spend much time with her. Warrant1987 Community Answer It depends on the weight and size of your bunny.  You can always check with your vet to be sure.  For my full size Rex, we give 1/8 cup as she tends to gain weight easily.  While outside time is great when the weather is good, inside fun in a rabbit-proofed room can be great for her exercise and good for interaction between you both.  If she is housed in a small space like a cage or hutch, switch her to a exercise pen to give her room to move when you are not home.  It is much healthier for them.  Also, make sure to stay away from alfalfa hay or pellets with alfalfa in them.  Timothy based pellets are best.  Thanks!

Pet store treats usually contain too much sugar and starch and contribute to weight gain.  Thanks!  Helpful 2 Not Helpful 0 Avoid dry fruits.  They have more sugar than fresh fruit.  Thanks!  Helpful 0 Not Helpful 0 Adult rabbits should be provided unlimited amounts of Timothy hay.  Baby rabbits should only be fed Alfalfa hay.  Thanks!\n\n\nHelpful 2 Not Helpful 0 Make sure your rabbit gets at least one hour of exercise outside his/her cage each day. Thanks!  Helpful 1 Not Helpful 0 Rabbits need plenty of exercise - preferably on grass, as it is a wild rabbit's staple diet.  Also, try not to give rabbits any lettuce, as there is no fibre and mainly water-based.  Try parsley, kale, green beans, carrot leafs, broccoli and even brussel sprout leaves!  However, do not feed them too much of any of one thing.  Thanks!  Helpful 0 Not Helpful 0 Warnings Make changes to your rabbit's diet gradually.  They have delicate digestive systems and might become sick if their portions are suddenly cut drastically or they switch types of pellets/hay without a transition period.  To transition between types of pellets or hay, start mixing some of the new type into the old type and gradually phasing out the old type over a week or two.  Thanks!  Helpful 5 Not Helpful 0 While having your rabbit fixed is an important preventive measure that all pet owners should consider unless they are intending to breed rabbits, be aware that being spayed or neutered can slow your rabbit's metabolism, causing it to gain weight more easily.  You will have to carefully adjust its diet accordingly.

Some breeds of rabbit are larger than others, but overall size doesn't indicate a weight problem.  {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5f\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5f\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-3.jpg\\/aid4477986-v4-728px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"License: Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} 3 Acknowledge the obvious signs of obesity.  If your rabbit obviously has huge rolls of fat and you can't see his feet when he walks, he's probably overweight.\n\n\nHowever, don't be alarmed if your rabbit has a pocket of fat under its chin. This is called a dewlap.  They are very common in females, but males may have them too.  Check to see that your rabbit is generally pear-shaped; his head should be smaller than his body, which should be narrow and widen out around his hips when he is sitting down.  If your rabbit resembles more of a squishy round blob when he's sitting, he is definitely overweight.  There should also be a smooth upward curve between the rabbit's hips and shoulder.  Feel for the rabbit's spine.  If you can feel it easily, your rabbit is too thin.  If you can feel it after pressing a little (gently), your rabbit is healthy.  If you can't feel it at all, your rabbit is overweight.\n\n\n{\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f5\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f5\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-4.jpg\\/aid4477986-v4-728px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"License: Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} 4 Weigh your rabbit on a scale. If you think you may need to be concerned about your rabbit's health, weigh your rabbit and make sure its weight is in a healthy range for its breed.  This may be difficult to do at home, so it might be best to take your rabbit to the vet to be weighed.\n\n\n{\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/07\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-5.jpg\\/v4-460px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-5.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/07\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-5.jpg\\/aid4477986-v4-728px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-5.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"License: Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} 5 Examine your rabbit's diet to determine what might be causing the dangerous weight gain and adjust accordingly. A healthy adult rabbit's diet should consist of unlimited timothy hay and a reasonable amount of leafy green vegetables.  If your rabbit is under a year old, they should be given alfalfa hay, which is high in protein, but it is important that they transition to timothy hay when they're older.  Common owner mistakes that contribute to rabbit obesity include over-feeding of pellets, over-feeding of treats, and poor choices of vegetables.  Despite contrary belief, pellets should not make up the majority of a rabbit's diet; in fact, some rabbits are just fine without them.\n\n\nIf you want to include pellets in your rabbit's diet, make sure to buy timothy-based pellets with 18 to 20 percent fiber and between 14 percent and 16 percent protein. Don't buy pellets that claim to have dried vegetables or other additions, as they are unnecessary and often contribute to weight gain.  Also, keep in mind that an adult rabbit only needs 1/4 cup of pellet feed per day per 5 pounds of body weight.  Make sure you aren't feeding your rabbit too many treats.  It's fun to watch rabbits eat fruits and other treats, but those should only be given in moderation.  Rabbits should only eat around 2 ounces of fruit per day per ounce of body weight.  {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a4\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-460px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a4\\/Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-6.jpg\\/aid4477986-v4-728px-Help-an-Overweight-Rabbit-Lose-Weight-Step-6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"License: Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} 6 Give your overweight rabbit an opportunity to exercise.\n\n\nIf your house has been thoroughly rabbit-proofed, let your rabbit run around a room or the whole house for at least a couple of hours every day. If that isn't practical, buy an indoor dog pen and let them run around in there.  Be sure to provide them with toys (or another rabbit, if the two are bonded) to inspire them to play.

What should I do?\n\n\nI also can't spend much time with her. Warrant1987 Community Answer It depends on the weight and size of your bunny.  You can always check with your vet to be sure.  For my full size Rex, we give 1/8 cup as she tends to gain weight easily.  While outside time is great when the weather is good, inside fun in a rabbit-proofed room can be great for her exercise and good for interaction between you both.  If she is housed in a small space like a cage or hutch, switch her to a exercise pen to give her room to move when you are not home.  It is much healthier for them.  Also, make sure to stay away from alfalfa hay or pellets with alfalfa in them.  Timothy based pellets are best.  Thanks!

Thanks!\n\n\nHelpful 2 Not Helpful 0 Make sure your rabbit gets at least one hour of exercise outside his/her cage each day. Thanks!  Helpful 1 Not Helpful 0 Rabbits need plenty of exercise - preferably on grass, as it is a wild rabbit's staple diet.  Also, try not to give rabbits any lettuce, as there is no fibre and mainly water-based.  Try parsley, kale, green beans, carrot leafs, broccoli and even brussel sprout leaves!  However, do not feed them too much of any of one thing.  Thanks!  Helpful 0 Not Helpful 0 Warnings Make changes to your rabbit's diet gradually.  They have delicate digestive systems and might become sick if their portions are suddenly cut drastically or they switch types of pellets/hay without a transition period.  To transition between types of pellets or hay, start mixing some of the new type into the old type and gradually phasing out the old type over a week or two.  Thanks!  Helpful 5 Not Helpful 0 While having your rabbit fixed is an important preventive measure that all pet owners should consider unless they are intending to breed rabbits, be aware that being spayed or neutered can slow your rabbit's metabolism, causing it to gain weight more easily.  You will have to carefully adjust its diet accordingly.

Everyone knows that you’ll only lose weight if ultimately you consume less calories than you burn.  However, how you do these things, can make a huge difference in your ultimate results – both in how much weight and fat you lose as well as how quickly you do it.  Eating 1200 calories of doughnuts is not the same 1200 calories of lean protein, good fats and fruits and vegetables.  Therefore, arming yourself with the best information on how to do this the smartest way will help you lose the weight more effectively.  Walking first thing in the morning on an empty stomach is one of the best tips on how to naturally jumpstart and boost your metabolism.  Many years ago, my good friend Natalie turned me on to this tip – a brisk walk (or moderate cardio) first thing in the morning before eating.

Moderate cardio is an activity that puts you in the “fat burning zone” according to your heart rate.  The fat burning zone is 60-70% of your maximum heart rate.  To determine your maximum heart rate, calculate 220 – age (or 226 – age if you’re a woman).  For me, I’m a 31 year-old woman, so my maximum heart rate is 195 (226 – 31 = 195).\n",

To achieve this heart rate, you can use a heart rate monitor or count your heart beats per minute (take your pulse for 15 seconds and then multiply by 4).  You can do any any activity that gets your heart beating in the fat burning zone -- brisk walk, eliptical, biking, etc.  For me, I prefer a brisk walk with Xander, my German Shepherd.  It is imperative you do not exceed this rate for moderate cardio.  You do not want to be training harder, putting you in the cardiovascular/aerobic zone (70-80% of maximum heart rate) or the anaerobic/heavy conditioning zone (80-90%).  Therefore activities like running, sprinting, weightlifting, and swimming are too intense for this very specific exercise time and should be avoided.  Why on an empty stomach?  When you first wake up in the morning, you have very low blood sugar levels and glycogen stores because you haven’t eaten anything yet.  Glycogen is carbohydrate stored in the liver and muscles which is used as a fuel during exercise.\n",

Should I run before or after dinner?  If you are going to run for less than an hour, you should run before dinner.  One of the reasons why we eat before dinner is to provide fuel for the muscles.  But the body already has a stored fuel source (muscle glycogen) that can be used in short-term, hard activities.  It’s probably better to eat after running to recover from it.  If you run too soon after dinner, you will be prone to stomach cramps, stomachaches, or gastrointestinal distress.  The mechanical movements of the body that naturally occurs while running can upset the digestive tract.  It's strongly recommended to wait three to four hours before running after eating a sumptuous dinner.  Do run at least 2 hours before bedtime to avoid endorphins to get in the way of your sleep.

Even the fittest and most disciplined of us can succumb, indulging in more fat and calories than at any other time of the year.  The health consequences,  if the behavior is unchecked, can be swift and worrying.  A recent study by scientists in Australia found that after only three days, an extremely high-fat, high-calorie diet can lead to increased blood sugar and  insulin resistance, potentially increasing the risk for Type 2 diabetes.  Waistlines also can expand at this time of year, prompting self-recrimination and unrealistic New Year’s resolutions.

Running on an empty stomach – yes or no?  There are lots of different opinions on this topic.  For some, it is a regular part of their training, while for others, working out on any empty stomach is out of the question.  In today’s blog post, we are going to look at the three biggest myths and show you the truth behind them.  1.  “Working out on an empty stomach leads to muscle loss” The general opinion in the gym is that working out without breakfast leads to muscle loss.  But don’t worry, your muscles won’t disappear right away.  It is often wrongly assumed that without food intake, the body lacks the necessary carbohydrates and glucose (sugar) for a training session in the morning.  According to this view, the body is forced to break down muscle protein to get the energy it requires.  So in other words, the body loses muscle.\n",

                            "text": "\nBut this is not exactly 100% accurate: The body stores glucose in the form of glycogen (stored form of sugar) in the liver and muscles. Over the course of the night, the body’s levels of insulin (which helps cells absorb sugar and inhibits fat loss) and liver glycogen decrease.  But the body still has the muscle glycogen stores.  So when you start your morning run, your body initially gets its energy from the glycogen stored in your muscles.  But as your workout continues, the stores of glycogen – or simply, carbohydrates – in your muscles are virtually depleted.  Therefore, your body is forced to find a different supply of energy and it increasingly resorts to free fatty acids for fuel.  If you now crank up the intensity of your workout, your body, in order to make up for the lack of glycogen and the insufficient supply of energy from fats, will also obtain the energy it needs by breaking down proteins (i.e. amino acids).  Only then do you run the risk of losing muscle.  However, most runners will have already stopped their workout by this point.  For a massive lack of glycogen is normally accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness, weakness and fatigue.  2.\n",

                            "text": "\n“Running on an empty stomach is the best method to lose weight” Working out on an empty stomach is often touted as the best way to burn fat and lose weight. While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  “Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance” Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.\n",

Watergate was empowering in a sense: It told you that the authority figures were flawed, perhaps deeply so, that you should not blindly trust the powerful.  Bad men do bad things, and lie about them, and it is our challenge to scrape away that deceit and find the truth beneath.  There is much talk this week of the “scandals” breaking in Washington, and we are offered three, a tidy triumvirate.  The IRS.  Benghazi.  The government snooping on the Associated Press.  Many of us who are old hands, who are tenured scandal-watchers, are for the moment somewhat unimpressed by the scale and potential reach of these scandals.  So is my young colleague Ezra Klein.  At the moment, this isn’t Watergate, or Iran-Contra, or Lewinsky.  In my day a scandal would sear your eyeballs.  What makes a scandal not only momentarily compelling but historically significant is when it reaches the condition of automatic self-regeneration.  It has to spark new elements continuously.\n",

A person I never heard of got sacked (and he was “interim”).  At the core of the Benghazi story is a tragedy, but so much of the furor is about spin.  There’s talk of duplicitous tampering with “talking points.”  Do you think in the Nixon White House that G. Gordon Liddy was worried about talking points?  Do you think E. Howard Hunt ever had “spin” on his mind?  There was a time when most of us didn’t know who Liddy or Hunt were, or Haldeman, or Ehrlichman, or Mitchell, or any of the president’s men.  Woodward and Bernstein had pursued the story at The Post when few others in town wanted to touch it, but by the summer of 1973 it was all anyone could talk about.  The president’s men came to life via the magic of television, the hearings carried live through the summer, pre-empting the soaps.\n",

Incredibly, the scandal had been secretly taped.  And one of the tapes had a gap!  An 18 and a half minute gap!  Which Nixon blamed on Rose Mary Woods, his secretary.  Riiiiiiiiight.  The astonishing hypothesis of the Watergate scandal was that the Nixon White House had corruption in its DNA -- that the abuse of power was a routine matter for the administration, and that the president’s natural paranoia, his insecurity, his trickiness, had generated a malevolence and criminality that had spread to every root and twig of the organism.  The president had his defenders, of course, including one of my senators from Florida, Ed Gurney, who served on the Ervin committee.  The ranking Republican, Howard Baker, seemed committed to the truth no matter where it led him.  Sam Ervin, the chairman, was a lovable, simple country lawyer, as he put it.  The proceedings were, let it be noted, glacial.  I have no idea if today such hearings would have the same effect.\n",

It started off small, but by the end, the team of five burglars were demanding one million dollars each — every month.  One million dollars each, times five burglars, is five million dollars every month.  That is 60 million dollars every year.\n",

Then, a couple of terrific reporters looked into it, and began to figure it out, and wrote about it.  Then, Congress began to try to investigate, to see if it was really all that bad, and if the reporters were correct.  Then, a “Special Prosecutor” was hired, to look into it.

Learn more about the scandal, those involved, the investigation and Nixon's inevitable resignation.  Create an account Background to Watergate While many historians have pointed to the war in Vietnam as being a large component to the downfall of President Richard Nixon, the main culprit in the embattled leader's tainted presidency was the Watergate Scandal in 1972, which was Nixon's attempt at covering up an executive-led break-in at the Watergate office complex.  Nixon was known for his irrational behavior as President of the United States; for example, he employed what he called the 'madman theory' to psychologically terrorize the North Vietnamese into ending the Vietnam War.  Nixon was also renowned for his paranoia.  He believed that everyone was attempting to bring him down.  He distrusted the anti-war movement of the period, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), especially its leader J. Edgar Hoover, and many of his own cabinet members.\n",

Nixon ordered the staff, which became known as the 'plumbers,' to stop the leak of information and discredit Ellsberg.  Thus began Nixon's often illegal abuse of the executive privileges.

Two of the three democratic contenders failed to reach the Democratic National Convention due to injury or political mistakes.  As a result, South Dakota Senator George McGovern won the democratic nomination handily.  Unfortunately, McGovern did not stand a chance against Nixon, as the incumbent president crushed McGovern in both the electoral and popular vote.  Yet the election was tainted by information that was released in months that followed.\n",

The scandal also resulted in the indictment, trial, conviction and incarceration of 43 people, including dozens of Nixon's top administration officials.  The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate complex on June 17, 1972.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) connected cash found on the burglars to a slush fund used by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President, a fundraising group for the Nixon campaign.  In July 1973, as evidence mounted against the president's staff, including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the Senate Watergate Committee, it was revealed that President Nixon had a tape-recording system in his offices and he had recorded many conversations.  Recordings from these tapes implicated the president, revealing he had attempted to cover up the break-in.  After a protracted series of bitter court battles, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the president had to hand over the tapes to government investigators; he ultimately complied.\n",

On June 17, 1972, The Washington Post published a small story.  In this story the reporters stated that five men had been arrested breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee.  The headquarters was located in a Washington, D.C., building complex called Watergate.  These burglars were carrying enough equipment to wiretap telephones and take pictures of papers.  The Washington Post had two reporters who researched deep into the story.  There names were Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, they discovered that one of the suspects had an address book with the name and phone number of a White House official who could have been involved in the crime.  The reporters suspected that the break-in had been ordered by other White House officials.  In a press conference on August in 1972, President Nixon said that nobody on the White House Staff was involved in the crime.\n",

Watergate was connected to Vietnam, it eventually exposed a long series of illegal activities in the Nixon administration.  Nixon and his staff were found to have spied on and harassed political opponents, planned contributions to the campaign, and tried to cover-up their illegal acts.  These crimes that they did were called the Watergate scandal, named after the building that it happened.  For years Nixon was carrying on the crimes and they were not noticed until now.  1969 was the really date in which Watergate was really beginning.  It all started when the White House staff made up a list called \"enemies list\".  Nixon had enemies which include 200 liberal politicians, journalists and actors.  Most of these people made a public speech against the Vietnam war.  Nixon's aides formed a conducts tax audits on these people that he thought were enemies.  He also had agents find out secret information that would harm them.  Nixon was always worried about govt.  Employees revealing secret info.  To the news paper or any sort of press.\n",

They got the information from secret government papers.  The papers blamed the policies that were formed and caused the beginning of the war in Vietnam.  Daniel Ellsberg, a former employee , gave the documents to the paper.  Nixon became very angry by their publishes.  Nixon tied to make Ellsberg's actions a form of treason, but he was not content to take him to court.  Instead he made a secret group of CIA agents they were called the \"plumbers\" this is a name made up because they cover up leaks, such as the pentagon papers, that could hurt the White House.  While they were searching for info.  They found Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office.  They discovered nothing wrong.  The next time the plumbers are involved is the next election.  Nixon was always worried about having enough votes for the election in 1972.  Nixon was concerned that Edmund Muskie of Maine would win because he was the strongest Democratic candidate.\n",

But the effects of Watergate lingered on for years after the scandal.  The investigation into the break-in by Nixon campaign workers in June 1972 at the Democratic campaign headquarters at Washington’s Watergate complex led directly to the White House, and by early August 1974, President Nixon faced near-certain impeachment, and a Senate trial, as the allegation unfolded.  Nixon resigned in a nationally televised speech and left Washington on August 9, 1974, as Gerald Ford became president.  Over the years, the scandal has been replayed in various forms.  But here are five significant trends that came out of a story that developed over two years and captivated the nation.  1.  The Supreme Court remained supreme.  It was a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court on July 24, 1974 that effectively ended the Nixon presidency by ordering the release of the Watergate “smoking gun” tape and other recordings.\n",

More importantly, the Court said, were \"the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of justice.\"  The Court's curb on executive power remains crucial today.  2.  The Church Committee.  Concerns surfaced during the Watergate hearings about the FBI investigating American citizens and others for political purposes.  The claims were accelerated by a post-Watergate story from the New York Times about CIA allegations about domestic spying.  The Church Committee held hearings during the post-Watergate years about these and other secret activities.  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 was an outgrowth of the committee’s investigations, and it created the special FISA court to authorize surveillance operations when driven by national security concerns.  3.  An era of legal reform.  The Watergate scandal shined a negative light on the legal profession.  Many of the participants in the scandal were attorneys and almost 30 of them faced some type of legal proceeding.  After Watergate, most law schools in the United States required courses about professional responsibility, and the American Bar Association rewrote its responsibility code.  4.  The era of celebrity journalists.\n",

James Fallows allegedly came up with the term in the 1980s about the growing pop-culture phenomenon of celebrity journalists who were bigger than the stories they covered.  They are commonplace today in all forms of media.  5.  A legacy of language.  Words and sayings from Watergate are part of the common language of America, from President Nixon’s famous “I am not a crook” statement to President Ford’s declaration that “our national nightmare is over.”  But nothing has been more prevalent that the use of suffix “gate” to indicate a scandal.  The late William Safire, a former Nixon speechwriter, took to using “gate” to describe scandals.  By one count, more than 200 scandals have had “gate” attached to them!

A national guessing game that had been played for 31 years seemed over.  Yet the arrival of Deep Throat in the flesh created new complications, as media scholar Matt Carlson observed in 2010.  A stroke-afflicted Felt was unable to speak on his own behalf; simultaneously, \"Woodstein\" (as the reporting duo were known internally at the Post) could no longer dictate the terms for how to think about Deep Throat.\n",

AFP/Getty Nothing did more to stoke these doubts than a 2012 biography of Ben Bradlee, Woodward and Bernstein's fabled editor at the Post.  In Yours in Truth, author Jeff Himmelman, a former Woodward disciple, described how he found an interview recorded while Bradlee was preparing his autobiography in the early 1990s.  In it, the Post editor expressed doubts about Woodstein's portrayal of Deep Throat in their book on the investigation, All the President's Men.  \"There's a residual fear in my soul that that isn't quite straight,\" Bradlee told the interviewer in 1990.  Himmelman also found in Bradlee's papers a memo from Bernstein that described his clandestine encounter in December 1972 with a source identified only by the code name \"Z.\"  In All the President's Men, the information provided by \"Z\" was put on a par with disclosures made by Deep Throat.\n",

Felt was an FBI special agent who eventually rose to the position of Associate Director, the Bureau's second-highest-ranking post.  Felt worked in several FBI field offices prior to his promotion to the Bureau's headquarters.  In 1980, he was convicted of having violated the civil rights of people thought to be associated with members of the Weather Underground, by ordering FBI agents to break into their homes and search the premises as part of an attempt to prevent bombings.  He was ordered to pay a fine, but was pardoned by President Ronald Reagan during his appeal.   In 2005, at age 91, Felt revealed that during his tenure as associate director of the FBI he had been the notorious anonymous source known as \"Deep Throat\" who had provided \"The Washington Post\" reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with critical information about the Watergate scandal that had ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974.\n",

Their wedding was officiated by the chaplain of the United States House of Representatives, the Rev. Sheara Montgomery.  Audrey died in 1984; she and Felt had two children, Joan and Mark.   Felt stayed on with Pope's successor in the Senate, David Worth Clark (D-Idaho).  He attended the George Washington University Law School at night, earning his law degree in 1940, and was admitted to the District of Columbia Bar in 1941.   Upon graduation, Felt took a position at the Federal Trade Commission but did not enjoy his work.  His workload was very light, and he was assigned to investigate whether a toilet paper brand, called \"Red Cross\", was misleading consumers into thinking it was endorsed by the American Red Cross.  Felt wrote in his memoir:  My research, which required days of travel and hundreds of interviews, produced two definite conclusions:  1.  Most people \"did\" use toilet tissue.   2.\n",

According to the authors, Deep Throat was a key source of information behind a series of articles that introduced the misdeeds of the Nixon administration to the general public.  The scandal eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, as well as to prison terms for White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, G. Gordon Liddy, Egil Krogh, White House Counsel Charles Colson, former United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell, former White House Counsel John Dean, and presidential adviser John Ehrlichman.

Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it.  J. Anthony Lukas speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years (1976), based on three New York Times Sunday Magazine articles, but he was widely criticized.

On May 31, 2005, Vanity Fair revealed that Felt was Deep Throat in an article on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf.

This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes “natural” laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence.  Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”?  Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment?  In this paper, I plan to do two things.  First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives.  Second, I plan to discuss a possible objection to Bostrom’s argument, and how this might affect our personal probability for the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation.\n",

This is simply the claim that if we were able to model the mind with enough detail, then we would be able to create artificial minds capable of thought in the same way that we are.  He goes further to assume that, if we were able to simulate the entire world in sufficient detail, and feed this world into the artificial minds we have created in the form of sensory inputs, the artificial minds would be incapable of determining that they were in a simulation, unless they were given explicit knowledge of it by the creators of the simulation.  Bostrom then goes on to assert that it would be theoretically possible to create a machine with enough computing power to simulate both the human mind and the universe in sufficient detail to create a simulation that would be indistinguishable from our universe by the population of the simulation.  This is based on projections of the advancement of current technology as well as on current theoretical designs of possible computing machines.  This assumption, although a grand one, will be considered a valid one for the purposes of this review of the argument.  This moves Bostrom into the main part of his argument.\n",

Instead, I will give a general form of the argument in prose, and reproduce a small section of the probability theory later during my critique of the argument.  Bostrom begins by giving an estimate of the fraction of all people in existence that are simulated people, who don’t exist at the fundamental level of reality.  He estimates this as the expectation of the number of simulated people divided by the expectation of the number of simulated people plus the number of real people.  The expectation of the number of simulated people is equal to the probability of simulations being done times the average number of simulations that would be done if simulations were done times the average number of people in each simulation.  Bostrom argues that this calculation gives us the fraction of all people in existence that are actually simulated people and not “real” people.  Bostrom then makes an appeal to the principle of indifference.  This principle states that when there is no independent reason to believe one proposition over another, the probability that the proposition is true is equal to the number of possible ways that the proposition could turn out to be true divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n",

With the advent of computers, the idea took on new life, especially in recent years, with films like Inception, Dark City, and the Matrix trilogy.  Is it possible that the world is just a computer simulation? 10 Ancestor Simulators Computers now process huge amounts of data, and some of the most intense and productive tasks involve simulations.  Simulations consider multiple variables and use artificial intelligence to analyze them and examine outcomes.  Some simulations are games.  Some are models of real-life situations, such as the spread of disease.  Some are “history simulators,” which can be games (like Sid Meyer’s Civilization) or can mimic the real-life growth of society over time.  That’s how simulations run now, but computers keep getting faster.  Processing power has doubled periodically for decades, and computers 50 years from now may well be millions of times more powerful than any today.  Better computers would bring much bigger and better computer simulators—including history simulators.\n",

But would it be moral?  Humans are complex beings with feelings and relationships.  Mightn’t there be something wrong in creating a whole fake world of them?  Wouldn’t the responsibility for every action in that universe fall on our shoulders, and wouldn’t it be too much for us to bear?  Maybe.  But that doesn’t matter.  Because to some people, the idea of running a simulation would just be too tempting.  And even if, for whatever reason, history simulators were illegal, it would just take a single person to run one and create our reality.  It would take just one person, who’d consider the matter no more significant than a game of The Sims.  People may also have good reasons for creating such simulators, beyond just entertainment.  Humanity could be facing death, forcing scientists to create our world as a massive diagnostic test.\n",

If you were to grow a brain in a vat and manipulate it with stimuli, it wouldn’t know it’s in a vat.  It would assume itself a living, breathing, active person.  But even advanced simulations can have flaws, right?  Wouldn’t we notice some imperfections, some “glitch in the Matrix”?  Maybe we do see such glitches in our everyday lives.  The Matrix offered the example of déjà vu—when something seems inexplicably familiar, the simulation may be skipping like a scratched CD.  Supernatural elements, like ghosts or miracles, could also be glitches.  According to simulation theory, people really do witness these phenomena, and they do so because of bugs in the simulation’s code.  The Internet offers plenty of anecdotal evidence of these glitches.  Keep your mind and eyes open, and maybe you’ll see some for yourself.  7 Math Makes Up Life Everything in the universe is quantifiable in some way.

When I am in what seems like a negative situation – maybe I have been lazy, made a mistake, failed or stumbled in some kind of way – then I like to ask myself questions like: What is one thing that is positive or good about this situation?  What is one opportunity within this situation?  Doing so is a whole lot better than what I used to do in such situations.  Because back then I usually asked myself how much I sucked and how things could get even worse now.  I do however not always use these questions right away.  Oftentimes I need a bit of time to process the thoughts and feelings that arise in situation before I can do that.  Trying to force optimistic thinking when you are still in an emotional turmoil or a bit shocked usually don’t work that well.  2\n",

To be able to stay positive it is essential to have influences in your life that support you and lift you up instead of dragging you down.  So carefully consider what you let into your mind.  You can for example ask yourself: Who are the 3 most negative people I spend time with?  What are the 3 of most negative sources of information I spend time on?  Consider the answers.  Then think about how you can start spending less time with one of those people or information sources this week.

She is very knowledgeable and she reads the kid very well.  She knows where they need help and where they struggle.  Finding the real need for the kid is more important and it will help the kids getting to the right direction.  I would definitely recommend her.  Thanks a lot Ms.Jeanine !!!  We have been seeing Keri for a couple of months now.  She has helped my daughter so much during our visits.  She is attentive to my daughters needs and feelings.\n",

Keri is always one step ahead of her to extinguish any excuses she has, in the most encouraging way.  Keri has worked hard to gain my daughters trust.  We are thankful for Keri!  We were SO grateful for Jeanine at Frisco Feeding Speech Therapy.  My pediatrician referred me to her for a maxillary lip tie and latching issues.  My son is 2 months old and she was so gentle, loving, and kind to the both of us.  She made sure to take adequate time discussing with me my son’s symptoms, what I’ve noticed as a mom, etc.  She then evaluated him herself, reassuring me that even though I’m a first time mom, my mom instinct was right.  She was encouraging to both my son and I when she was giving us new strategies to work on, and gave research based advice, and fellow mom advice, too.  😉 She sat with us though an entire feeding to show me every new strategy and to let me try them while I was there and had her help.  I was very nervous going into my son’s evaluation, but as soon as we got settled and began talking, I just knew I was in the right place.\n",

Cats just in my opinion kind of lack personality.  And no dog has the same personality.  Trust me.  I have 5 dogs and they're all so different!  One is my HUGE labradoodle who's 100 pounds.mhe isn't very smart but he is the sweetest dog I've ever met.  He looks big and scary but he's a huge softie and lays his head on you.

They're the one thing that loves YOU more than they love themselves.  And that's a fact If you don't have a dog you won't understand.

Updated: 11/23/2019 Create an account Who Are You?  If you have ever read Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, you probably remember the infamous Caterpillar perched on his mushroom.  The first thing he says to little Alice is, ''Who... are... you?''  Alice responds with, ''Why, I hardly know, sir.  I've changed so much since this morning, you see.''  Alice is experiencing a crisis of self-identity.  Self-identity is defined in many ways and with many theories within psychology; however, it is most easily explained by understanding all the parts that can make up our self-identity.\n",

Although it sounds like a simple question, are you finding it hard to choose words to describe your personality?  Self-identity is a very complex idea.  So complex, in fact, that even those who actively work on understanding themselves and their self-identity still have great difficulty.  Some aspects of self-identity can be identified and described by others.  When thinking about how to define yourself, did you use the words that describe your job, hobbies, family ties, nationalities, religious beliefs, and group affiliations?  But how about what you think?  Your morals and values cannot truly be known by anybody else; nobody else can hear your thoughts.  These parts of self-identity can only be truly explained by you.  Let's go back to Alice in Wonderland.  How do you think she should have responded to the Caterpillar?  Alice could have stated many things, including her name, her age, her height and weight, and other physical descriptors.  She could also say that she is a daughter, a sister, a student, a cat-owner, and a book-lover.  All of those last descriptors involve relationships with other people.\n",

One may have just been checking her hair using her camera as a mirror, but the other two were definitely posing.  I know this because one of them used the infamous duck face and the other threw up a peace sign as she snapped the picture.  It was 7:12 a.m.  Too early for selfies, in my opinion.  Even though it’s nothing new, I’m still amazed by how much social media has taken over the lives of our teenagers.  They spend just as much time interacting online as they do interacting in person.  I see them sitting across from each other in the cafeteria with their phones over their faces, as they text each other and post their stories to Snapchat.  It is an obsession and has become almost a responsibility in their lives that they feel compelled to keep up with.  All of that got me thinking.

And, most of all, how can we follow these same guidelines to set a good example for our kids?  How Social Media Lowers Our Teens’ Self-Esteem: It causes them to live in a world of self promotion No matter what they post, they measure their self-worth on how many “likes” or “comments” the post gets.  This turns the posting into an addiction and a determiner of their beauty, worth, popularity and validity.  If a post doesn’t get a lot of likes or receives a negative comment they may assume they must be uncool, stupid or not good enough.  How to prevent it: Encourage your teenager that their inner beauty, unique qualities and how they treat others are what more important.  Help them realize that anyone that measures their worth by their social media profiles, is not a true friend.  It makes them constantly compare themselves to others Social media provides a constant outlet for the trap of comparison which subsequently creates feelings of depression and low self-worth in many teens.  Pay attention to statements that use “like” and “as” from your teen.\n",

How to prevent it: As adults, we need to help our teenagers face the challenges social media brings.  If we allow our teenagers to use social media, then we need to parent more intently and deliberately.  We need to focus on nurturing their self-esteem and showing them that their self-worth should be rooted in being a good person, working hard and helping others, not in the cuteness of their outfit or how many followers they have on Instagram.  Since we can’t simply say “Keep your teen off social media until they are secure in their self-esteem”, encourage them to follow accounts that promote positive body image, lift others up and show good examples for your teen to follow.  Some examples of these are: @aerie @kindcampaign @soulpancake @amypoehlersmartgirls @thegoodquote It inhibits their experiences Many teens will participate in experiences (or not participate) “for the Instagram”.  If they think going to a new place in town or even spending some time outside will make for a good picture, they are more inclined to participate.  How to prevent it: Show your teen by example that experiences don’t always need to be photographed.\n",

The Derby masters were sold to RCA where Newton became an executive.   In 1955, Newton became General Manager of Murray Katz's Treat Records, then located at 236 West 55 Street in Manhattan.  In 1956, he joined ABC-Paramount as sales manager where, in 1959, he rose to vice president of sales and, in 1965, president.   1967 saw Newton's most infamous decision: to not promote Louis Armstrong's recording of the song \"What a Wonderful World\".  The song had been written with Armstrong in mind, but when Armstrong, who had recently signed with ABC Records, was recording it, Newton tried to stop the recording session, because he disliked the slow pace.  Newton was physically locked out of the studio, and the session continued with him fuming outside.\n",

George Weiss recounts in the book Off the Record: Songwriters on Songwriting by Graham Nash that he wrote the song specifically for Louis Armstrong.

Newton was locked out of the studio for his disruption, but a second problem arose: nearby freight train whistles interrupted the session twice, forcing the recording to start over.  Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure.  The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected.  To make sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 musicians union scale for his work.  The song was not initially a hit in the United States, where it sold fewer than 1,000 copies because Newton did not like or promote it, but was a major success in the United Kingdom, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart.\n",

Made my hair huge.  So naturally, our house sprung a leak.  (My house is nearly 100 years old.  Give it a break.)  Of course that leak had to be outside my bedroom window.  Not into my bedroom, mind you; my life isn’t quite that awful.  No, through the section of roof outside my window to the living room below.  Which is nice because it means that my stuff didn’t get rained on all day.  But it did mean that we had to put plastic bags outside my window to “stop” the leak.  I don’t know how well that worked out.\n",

Experts believe the first Native Americans came from Asia.  Thousands of years ago, what is now Siberia in Russia was connected to what is now Alaska in the U.S. by a land bridge.  This area across the Bering Sea was called Beringia.  People were able to cross Beringia into what is now Alaska.  Over thousands of years, many different and distinct tribes and ethnic groups crossed over into this new territory and began to spread across all of what is now North America.  Many of these tribes still exist today.  These early Native Americans lived mainly off the land, relying upon hunting and gathering of wild plants and animals.  They occupied land for use by the entire community.  This is very different from the European colonists' concept of ownership or individual property rights.  After the arrival of European colonists, Native Americans suffered many deaths due to diseases brought from overseas.  There was also increasing conflict with the colonists who wanted to “ civilize \" them and teach them unfamiliar farming methods.  After the Civil War, westward expansion brought western Native American tribes into greater conflicts that resulted in a series of “Indian wars.\"\n",

These nearly three million Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada speak over 150 different Native American languages.  At times, the terms used to refer to Native Americans have been controversial.  According to U.S. Census Bureau statistics, though, it appears that most Native Americans prefer to call themselves American Indians or simply Indians.  The Native Americans in the U.S. can be divided into over 560 separate tribes.  Even though they're all considered Native Americans, their languages, clothing, customs, and cultures can vary greatly from one tribe to another.  These diverse tribal cultures celebrate their unique identities and contributions in many ways.  Through independent newspapers, community schools, tribal councils, native colleges, museums, arts and crafts programs, and language preservation, the modern descendants of these many tribes continue to survive and thrive in the modern society they helped to build.

Here I will elaborate on what I consider to be the emperor's top five achievements.  1.  Unifying China pinterest-pin-it Qin Shihuan conquered all of the states in China, ending the Warring States period.  The most important achievement under Qin Shihuang is the unification of China.  After the Qin state conquered all others, ending the Warring States period, Qin Shihuang declared himself the first emperor—until that point, there had only been kings.  With that, he founded the first Chinese dynasty.  He continued to expand the Qin dynasty after unifying China, going as far south as Vietnam.  This laid a solid foundation for future Chinese dynasties until the collapse of the Qing dynasty in the early 1900s.  The second most important of his achievements was the reinforcement of legalism within the Chinese administrative systems.\n",

                            "text": "\nThe impact of this achievement far outlasted the Qin dynasty, and survives even under the current Communist rule. Legalism is a Chinese philosophy best captured in The Book of Lord Shang.  It assumes that people are essentially bad and that the only way to maintain public order is through strict laws and severe penalties.  It had a great influence on the operation of the Qin dynasty.  Another important change was that meritocracy was valued over aristocracy within the government.  The high officials and generals could be anybody who had the skill and the competence for those posts, and only the ruler of the state derived his privilege from birthright.  This had a fundamental impact on future Chinese dynasties, in which examinations were introduced to promote people into government capacities, as opposed to inheriting the positions, as had been done in the past.  pinterest-pin-it Qin Shihuang restructured China into military districts so that states would not fall into war once more.  The military was so important to him that he built the Terracotta Army to aid him in the afterlife.  Qin Shihuang's third most important achievement was reforming the political arrangements to ensure China would not fall again into the divisive conflict of the Warring States period.  To form a more coherent state, Qin Shihuang created commanderies, or military districts, within all the conquered states.\n",

Qin Shi Huang was the first emperor to unify China.  Discovered by a farmer in 1974, the army of the Terracotta Warriors is one of the famous archaeological finds of the century.  Discoveries continue to be unearthed around the site at the foot of Lishan Mountain, so even if you have been before a return visit is an interesting thing to do in Xian .  The discovery of European DNA has led experts to a surprising conclusion that the Ancient Greeks might have helped with the construction of the Terracotta Army 1500 years before Marco Polo visited China.  Marco Polo was believed to be the first European to explore China.\n",

If you haven’t been to the Great Wall of China, then it’s worth ticking off your bucket list.  The historical landmark in China was a project of Ming Dynasty Emperor Shih Huang Ti, who thought that it would defend China from Mongolian invaders.  It was a failed project and 200,000 workers who lost their lives working on the construction of the Great Wall.  The workers who died are buried beneath the structure.  Today, this Chinese landmark is one of the most well-known in the world and can be seen from outer space.  Winter is a thrilling time to visit the Great Wall of China and the best time to go to avoid the crush of tourists.  You won’t have to fight your way through the crowds as you walk the narrow ramparts.  You can enjoy the leisurely walk along the ramparts alone with no crowds but if you do go in winter, make sure to dress warmly.\n",

In today’s Asia for Kids lesson plan, we will learn about the continent in general, but then we will focus on India, China and Japan.  We will take virtual tours of all three countries, play Chinese Chess, make DIY henna tattoos (using just two ingredients!), cook easy sushi (that doesn’t involve rolling!), and even learn how to say some phrases in Hindi, Chinese and Japanese.\n",

Ellora's Kailasantha cave temple remains one of the true \"wonders\" of the world of art and a unique monument to Hindu devotion.  Captain Philip Meadows Taylor  (1808-1876) author, says: \"the carving on some of the pillars, and of the lintels and architraves of the doors, is quite beyond description.  No chased work in silver or gold could possibly be finer.  Bu what tools this very hard, tough stone could have done wrought and polished as it is, is not at all intelligible at the present day.\"  Indian art is so intimately associated with Indian religion and philosophy that it is difficult to appreciate it fully unless one has some knowledge of the ideals that governed the Indian mind.  In Indian art there is always a religious urge, a looking beyond.\n",

The interior is composed of 3 distinct parts in which the visitor follows a natural progression.  The first part is to the south, it is the entrance of the site, the inner courtyard.  Named \"Jilaukhana\", it has 3 gates (East, South and West) allowing entry and exit to the tourist site.  This part is a bit of a lock between the external life, vibrant, and inner, spiritual.  It is centered on a courtyard bordered by lawn.  At the corners are 4 pavilions, the 2 mausoleums of the first two wives of Shah Jahan, and two functional buildings now containing the tourist office.  To the north is the great gateway to the gardens, which symbolizes the passage to Paradise.  This door is called \"Darwaza-i rauza\".  The second part is the gardens of the Taj Mahal.  They symbolize the Paradise and everything must be perfect there, that's why the lawns are impeccable and each element is perfectly ordered.\n",

As strange as it may sound, keeping a secret is one hell of a difficult job to do.  We’ve all got secrets.  Secrets are of many types.  There are harmless, jovial, funny, gossipy secrets but in this very piece, I am focusing on that disturbing failure in keeping secrets done solely with malicious intent and calculated towards damaging someone’s reputation.  To keep a secret can be so hard and difficult for so many people to the extent that the only way out for them to relieve themselves off such a great burden will be just to spill the beans not minding whose ox is eventually gored in the process.  I perfectly understand these people.  Sometimes the compulsion or urge to say something or just voice it out could be so strong that they will no other option other than to say it all.  Sometimes gossip is fun and interesting and people really love to gossip, I know.  Some other people are of the habit of NOT keeping any secret at all and they see it as fun when they reveal everything that they were not told to say.  These groups of people don’t even know when they are doing it.\n",

Just tell them, “please this is a big secret”, watch their eyes start to glow almost immediately and then seat back and watch the grapevine start to rumble.  To these people, they derive their pleasure by doing it.  Ironically, they will even start divulging the said secret by telling you that “please, this is a secret”.  Very funny indeed.  Have you heard this statement before: “three people can keep a secret if two are dead”?  This statement implies that keeping a secret is almost impossible for (most) people to do.  But I don’t think it is supposed to be like that.  Why is keeping secret so hard?  In my opinion, it is simply because the person who is spilling the beans by revealing all those hidden details must have missed the importance of being able to keep secret.  So as a reminder, I am going to base our discussion today on the different reasons why I believe it is still a very nice virtue for one to be able to keep a secret.  Trust and Confidence Of course, keeping secrets helps in building massive trust and confidence in our daily relationship with other people.\n",

It is the sandy concealment that hangs like a haze over Zuba Town.  The other mountains in and around it stay a considerable distance from it, which the Zuba people see as a form of respect being paid by the other mountains to Zuma Rock for its royal presence in the locality.\n",

And just as the naysayers say size doesn’t matter, you realise that in West Africa, where just a couple of miles adds another fascinating tribal group, or that journey over the Obudu Plateau makes the difference between Guinean savannah grasses and verdant tropical rainforest, it really, really does!  The point is that Nigeria is a country of many colors and creeds.  Its character morphs and shapeshifts almost as elegantly as a white-throated monkey swings between the boughs of the jungle.  City wise, it’s got the colossal sprawl of Abuja – one of the fastest growing urban areas in the world.  And then there’s Lagos – 17.5 million strong, but still finding time to chill on the Atlantic beaches.  Moving away from the towns and to the country, and Nigeria’s many faces continue.  This time they peer like humans in the form of chimpanzees from the forest-clad gorges of the Gashaka Gumti.  Or, they are plumed in pink like the black cranes of the Bade-Nguru Wetlands.  It’s all very wonderful stuff.\n",

Calabar Source: flickr Calabar The gateway to the reserves of the Cross River (the state of which Calabar is the capital), and the further-flung rainforests of the Afi Mountains (home to gorillas, chimps, rare rockfowl and craggy peaks of stone), the town of Calabar is a well-honed tourist stop-off on the way through to Cameroon or the southern Nigerian coast.  Before making a beeline for the amazing primate sanctuaries outside of the town though, be sure to linger a little and case out the darker past of the city at the Calabar Museum – Calabar was once one of the principle slave trading ports in West Africa.  Also worth a look is the Duke Town chapel, which is considered one of the oldest Christian worshipping houses in Nigeria. 2. Lagos Source: flickr Lagos Frenetic and packed, Lagos is not only the largest city in Nigeria, but also the single largest on the entire African continent.  Yep, nearly 18 million people call this one home, and boy does it show!  Throbbing streets of beer bars and clubs pepper the districts of Ikeja and Victoria Island, where ex-pats and sailors and locals alike chat over frothy brews.\n",

Abeokuta Source: flickr Abeokuta Nestled inland, directly north of sprawling Lagos, the regional capital of the Ogun State can be found surrounded by great swathes of yam fields and maize farms, swaying wooded savanna and palm oil plantations.  An historic location on the important trade routes between the coast and the heart of West Africa led to previous inhabitants raising adobe fortifications around the old town, many of which can still be seen today.  However, it’s the bulbous rises of the Olumo Rock that soars atop the town that really draws the eye.  This ancient natural fort plays host to a great cultural museum, a craft shop selling local artworks, and caves that showcase the human history of the Ogun region as a whole.  4.\n",

However, be realistic and be ready for the unseen stuff.  For a 4 flat, to start moderate.  Here's \"some\" expenses You will need around 20-25k blocks to complete the house (around 5k for each flat, then foundation) .  Block is N100 each.  So u looking at 2.5mil To fence 2 plts u will need about 5k blocks= 500k Decking is around 1.5-2mill (Depending on when you do it.\n",

Creek Town was part of the Old Calabar region in the Bight of Biafra.  Old Calabar was a series of towns up the Cross River, which is in the Southeast edge of present-day Nigeria.  Honesty is an example of African agency in the Atlantic Slave Trade because he was a strong, savvy, and intelligent leader who worked with the Europeans instead of against them, which brought about changes that would forever affect the region.   Section::::Early life.   Although his exact date of birth is unknown, Eyo was cited to have been born in 1788 by an epitaph located on a tower of the Creek Town Presbyterian Church.  As a child, Eyo served as a cabin boy to English traders in the Triangle Trade network.  It was during this time that he learned to speak and write the English language.  He also learned the ways of the slave trade and how to do business which would benefit him as a ruler later on in life.  After his father lost the throne, his family fell upon hard times and Eyo found himself in the employment of his father's rival, the Great Duke Ephraim, after his father died in 1820.\n",

This ultimately resulted in Eyo I being removed from power as the Great Duke Ephraim made claims over the entire Calabar region.  Eyo, while serving in Duke Town, began to contact distant family in an effort to get them to come back to Creek Town and re-establish a lineage.  In 1834, the Eyo II house was formed and the Great Duke Ephraim died allowing Eyo to be crowned in 1835 or 1837, the date is uncertain.  His rule of the region would be marked with political agency through cooperation instead of confrontation with the Europeans.   Section::::European interaction.   Honesty welcomed the Europeans with open arms instead of fighting them with everything he had, like some rulers in the area did and had done.  He saw them as educated, learned men who could help him establish a stronger political hold in the region through economic power.\n",

He had dealt in slaves from both selling and buying as he was trying to employ enough men to run his aspiring palm oil industry.  His relationships with these \"super-cargoes\", huge trading outfits of the Triangular Trade Network, were well fostered and even gained him the name \"Honesty\" for his fair trade policies and willingness to work with the European traders.  However, in 1842 a Commander Raymond issued Eyo Honesty II and King Eyamba V, another ruler in the region, papers that negotiated the end of the slave trade.  On 4 December 1842, Honesty returned the signed Anti-Slave Trade Treaty to Raymond but took the opportunity to expand the economic market of Creek Town.  To compensate for the loss of slave trade Eyo invited the Europeans into his lands to set up industries that would diversify the economy.  Such industries to come would be cotton, coffee, sugar cane, and an immense increase in palm oil which had existed alongside of the slave trade.   Section::::Religion.   With the invite extended to the Europeans, missionaries were some of the first to come.\n",

McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in \"linguistic, historical or political patterns\".  Instead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of \"blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy\" as well as the religion of Islam.  Marc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia.\n",

To enhance the colour of the dish, tomato paste (purée) is added.  As seasoning spices, salt, seasoning/ stock cubes (a blend of flavour enhancers, salt, nutmeg and herbs), curry powder and dried thyme are used.  To complement the dish, chicken, turkey, beef or fish are often served with the dish.  Nigerian and Ghanaian rivalry Due to the differences in regional recipes, the various regions where jollof rice is common are competitive over which variant tastes the best.  This is especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana.  These differences have brought about the \"Jollof Wars\" between Nigeria and Ghana.

Marc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia.\n",

To enhance the colour of the dish, tomato paste (purée) is added.  As seasoning spices, salt, seasoning/ stock cubes (a blend of flavour enhancers, salt, nutmeg and herbs), curry powder and dried thyme are used.  To complement the dish, chicken, turkey, beef or fish are often served with the dish.  Nigerian and Ghanaian rivalry Due to the differences in regional recipes, the various regions where jollof rice is common are competitive over which variant tastes the best.  This is especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana.  These differences have brought about the \"Jollof Wars\" between Nigeria and Ghana.

Nigeria is a middle income, mixed economy and emerging market, with expanding financial, service, communications, technology and entertainment sectors.

Exports and government revenues are driven largely by oil, while most Nigerians work in agriculture.  Economic development is constrained by inadequate infrastructure, electricity, incentives, and policies that promote private sector development, and poor access to quality education.  Oil Oil has been the major gold pot for Nigeria since the 70’s, overturning the fortune gotten from the export of agricultural products.  Nigerian oil reserves are said to be an excess of 35billion and natural gas are well over 100 trillion cubic feet.  Poor Reforms Policies, over-dependency and the devaluing Naira have all summed up to be a bane in the oil sector.  Agriculture Even though Nigeria ranks sixth worldwide and first in Africa in agricultural output, agriculture has suffered from years of mismanagement, inconsistent and poorly conceived government policies, neglect and the lack of basic infrastructure.  Still, the sector accounts for over 26.8% of GDP and two-thirds of employment.  Transport Nigeria’s transportation infrastructure is a major constraint to economic development since transportation infrastructures continue to remain in bad shape.  Transport in Nigeria has also suffered a lot of setbacks due to poor management and maintenance.  Majority of Seaports, Airports, Railway systems, and Road transport facilities are way below average standards.\n",

Electricity Nigeria’s electricity production hasn’t been much to write home about, since the consumption continues to weigh down production.  Nigeria consumes an estimate of 18 billion Kilowatts and the production is way insufficient to have power supply on a regular.  Services Nigeria ranks 63rd worldwide and fifth in Africa in services output.  Low power generation has crippled the growth of this sector.  Economic growth from services output remains stymied by the high cost of doing business in Nigeria, crime threats and associated need for security counter measures, non-transparent economic decision making, especially in government contracting.  Other sectors have also contributed their tits and bits to economic development in Nigeria but no matter how ridiculously easy it sounds, there needs to be serious policy restructure, transparency in public-private partnership, and a change of mentality and attitude.\n",

This is more than triple the amount when compared to the previous year, which was around $1.7 billion.  In this article, the leading instant crypto exchange service ChangeNOW takes a look at the biggest Ponzi schemes and their mechanisms – and discusses how to make the crypto market a safer space.  What Is A Ponzi Scheme?  Generally, a Ponzi scheme (or a Pyramid scheme) is a form of investment – but in reality, a financial fraud – that attracts unsuspecting investors by promising them massive ROI in the shortest time.  The overall concept of a Ponzi scheme is to generate investment interests for early investors as new investors join the system.  What this means is that Ponzi schemes are driven by the constant flow of new investors into the system by collecting larger payouts from them to pay early investors.\n",

Let’s consider some common characteristics of a Ponzi scheme: There is no actual product Promises of guaranteed high investment returns with little or no risk Overly consistent returns on investments Organizers are often unregulated and unlicensed Difficulty receiving payments As with many other types of fraud, Ponzi scheme organizers usually leverage on the latest technology or product to attract potential investors to join the pool.  The decentralized and semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency makes it an appealing gateway for scammers to dole out massive profits from unsuspecting investors.  However, the idea behind crypto decentralization makes it possible to view every transaction made on the public ledger.  If so, how was it still possible for scammers to defraud people of their cryptocurrency assets?  Let’s examine their tactics.  How Does A Ponzi Scheme Work In Crypto?  Crypto Ponzi schemes follow a similar pattern as the traditional Ponzi schemes.  It basically works by appealing to people’s desire for fast profit, promising them a high yield of their investment.  Usually, the first set of investors get paid, which invariably seduces other people to join the gold rush.  Some crypto Ponzi scams use sophisticated and complex processes, even going as far as developing their own cryptocurrency exchanges to achieve their objective.  Other Ponzi scams use automated software to interact with people.\n",

The company promised a 1.2% return profit per day for 99 or 120 maturity days – the period when you are eligible to collect your principal amount and the profit that comes with it.  Investors were also encouraged to share their referral codes to other people to earn extra via their referrals.  Out of sheer excitement, most investors would post videos and blogs on social media to invite more people to join.  This model ensures that a stream of people continually moves into the system to keep it active.  Some Ponzi schemes push people to lose money even unintentionally.  Recently, three transactions in the Ethereum network have been sent with enormous fees, one of them being 10,668 ETH for a 0,55 ETH transaction (!).  It turned out that a little-known South Korean P2P crypto exchange Good Cycle that appears to be a Ponzi project has been hacked.

Promising limited risk to those who invest first, these scams guarantee to pay individuals using fresh capital obtained from new investors.  Often compared to pyramid schemes, there are a few Ponzi scheme examples to note.  But first, how did the Ponzi scheme start?  History of the Pyramid Scheme While historians say that he was not the inventor of such a fraud, Charles Ponzi made it famous.  Born in Italy in 1882, Ponzi was a professional swindler.  Around 1919, the Italian immigrant, who was determined to become wealthy, became inspired by international reply coupons (IRCs), which could be exchanged for postage stamps in other countries, according to Biography.com.  He realized he could trade these in for more than what he paid for them, then sell them.  Although doing this himself yielded a nice profit, he sought help to bring in a higher return.  His feature on Biography.com states that he would guarantee investors returns of 50 to 100 percent in 90 days or less.\n",

He was incarcerated in 2009 and sentenced to serve 25 years in prison.  However, he passed away in August 2016 before finishing his sentence, Billboard.com states.  J David & Company: J.

The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity (e.g. product sales and/or successful investments), and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds.  A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.  Some of the first recorded incidents to meet the modern definition of Ponzi scheme were carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the \"Ladies' Deposit\".\n",

In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well-known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in.  His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself.  Unlike earlier, similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed – this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.

The operator simply sends statements showing how much they have earned, which maintains the deception that the scheme is an investment with high returns.  Investors within a Ponzi scheme may even face difficulties when trying to get their money out of the investment.

Forsage Is Safe Because It's A Blockchain Currency Forsage argues investing with them is safe thanks to blockchain technology.  Yes, blockchain is secure but the problem is there are many third parties involved.  You have the cryptocurrency exchanges, the people making transactions, the hardware creators and the crypto miners.  So while the platform may be secure, there's zero security when it comes to the PEOPLE behind it.  Some of the shadiest scammers operate in the crypto space.  How Forsage Really Works To join Forsage, you need to make a one-time investment of 0.05 ETH, which is around $12 as I'm writing this review.

In return for cash investors received promissory notes, that guaranteed the original investment plus 50 percent interest.  These notes bore Ponzi‘s ink-stamped signature, many referred to them as “ Ponzi notes”.  It was a classical “ rob Peter to pay Pauline” scheme, that he did not invent nor did his conviction to three years in prison prevent other fraudsters from doing so.  In 1957, the Encyclopedia Britannica - the Wikipedia of it’s time - formally acknowledged that his name had become synonymous with swindle.  The Ponzi scheme officially had a name.  Listen to the story of Charles Ponzi Charles Ponzi’s Wikimedia entry assigns his occupation to the categories: Influenceur, Banker, Autobiographer.  No joke - in this order.

What Can We Learn From Charles Ponzi’s Scheme Related to Bitcoin?  Do not call frauds, where someone asks for bitcoin a “ bitcoin scam”.  Ponzi’s crime was not called “US dollar scam”.  The fraud was called after the guy, who pulled it off and not after the money, he cashed in.  Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme.  The only similarity between Bitcoin and a Ponzi scheme is the network effect of greed.  Investors who get in early, earn interest and tell others, who also want to get rich quick.  In a Ponzi scheme there is a centralized actor a leader or organization that collects investments and runs off in the end.  Bitcoin is auditable.  Bitcoin is an Open Blockchain and these are transparent, all transactions are traceable.  It is possible to proof where funds are.  If people would have invested bitcoin in Charles Ponzi’s scheme, it would have been possible to proof, if the funds have been moved - to buy a Locomobile for instance - or if they are still locked.  100 years ago Ponzi investors got a paper receipt with Ponzi’s signature in return, that promised a payout with interest.\n",

His thirty-eight years of life before were full of setbacks, misadventures, failures and even two times in jail in pursuit of riches.  Charles Ponzi was born in Lego, Italy, in spring 1882 named Carlo Ponzi.  His family was comfortable but far from wealthy, richer in reputation than in savings.  His father was descended from middle-class hoteliers and tradesmen, but was working as a postman.  His mother Imelde Ponzi’s family was part of the aristocracy in the duchy of Parma.\n",

Bitcoin was nothing more than an idea for years until it caught the attention of traders.  In the early stages of Bitcoin’s development until 2010, the world had no idea of bitcoin’s coming value.  The only people that knew about the cryptocurrency were tech-heads and gamers.  It was in this initial stage of the cryptocurrencies formative years, where one of the biggest financial blunders of all time occurred.  On May 22nd, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz – a Bitcoin enthusiast, made the world’s first Bitcoin transaction.  Laszlo ordered two Papa John’s pizza’s and paid for the delivery with 10,000 Bitcoins.\n",

Bitcoin got some notoriety in the gaming community over the coming years, but it wasn’t until Mt. Gox came onto the scene in 2011 that Bitcoin exploded into the mainstream.  Some 7-years later, and we are sitting at the threshold of Bitcoins 11th birthday.  Think about that for a minute.  Bitcoin is only 11-years old as a technology.  The amount of disruption this currency caused over the last 7-years is incredible to witness.  Japan recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate currency back in 2014, and many other nations followed suit.  Bitcoins ATMs are no readily available in many countries throughout the developed and emerging markets.  Today retailers accept Bitcoin as a means of payment, and the cryptocurrency even appears in popular culture in series like “Mr. Robot.”\n",

We’re here to give you an open and honest review about Amway so you can decide whether or not you want to be involved.  What is Amway?  Amway is a company that’s taken a lot of flack in recent years.  Unfortunately for people who are thinking about joining, a lot of the flack comes from people who are actually involved in the business or in other similar types of business.  Amway is actually one of the most disputed MLMs that you can join and is commonly attributed to being a pyramid scheme.  Whether or not this is actually true is a matter of definition and debate – pyramid schemes aren’t inherently bad, they just have a bad name.  But more on that later.  This brand mostly has a bad name because they had some trouble with the FTC.  But pretty much any massive MLM company like this will encounter at least some problems with the FTC.\n",

They were long-term dreamers and hoped to open a successful business, which they certainly did: it has survived for more than 50 years and has branches in more than 100 countries.  In fact, it’s the highest grossing network marketing company in the world.  They operate under their 4 marketing principles: freedom, family, hope, and reward.  It’s a good message to live your life by but honestly doesn’t do much to explain how the company works.  Read on to find out a bit more about that!  Amway: What Do They Sell?  Amway has a huge variety of products that they sell, and they don’t really fit into a single niche.  They have a huge range of things for sale, varying from nutritional and health supplements to beauty products to home care and cleaning products.  They have one of the biggest product lines of all the MLM companies that I’ve seen.  There are so many categories that their products fit into that I won’t have any time to list them all here.

Let me first say that you don't find many blacks in Buenos Aires.  The reason for this is rooted in history.  Unlike the Portuguese in Brazil, the Spanish who settled in Argentina did not bring in large numbers of African slaves to work plantations.  Therefore, today, you don't see very many black people in Buenos Aires.  I must admit that as a white guy and an expat, I'm not really able to discuss the Argentine people's feelings towards blacks.  Since the reader's question also deals with immigration, I asked Lorena Gallardo of Argentina Residency & Citizenship Advisors to respond to the reader.  Not only is she an expert on immigration law, but she's also Argentine, so she's going to be much better equipped to answer this question than I am.  The question and the response are both below.  Reader's Question I'm a Caribbean immigrant who grew up in New York, mostly Brooklyn, but now make my home in Manhattan.  I'm not a citizen here, even though I've been here since I was two years old.\n",

Paris is another such place--thoroughly cosmopolitan, but unaffordable, especially if I plan to be a \"semi-retired\" expat.  I've been considering Buenos Aires.  It's like Paris, New York and Rome mixed into one, but at a fraction of the cost!  I was just wondering what it's like for blacks in Buenos Aires.  I'd read that there aren't problems socializing, but there may be problems getting employment unless one is a dancer or musician; I am neither.  I do not, however, plan to be looking for work in Buenos Aires.  I'm considering it as a permanent expat home because it seems that I could live well on less than $1000USD/month.  Also, are there complications to getting permanent residency because my citizenship is with a Caribbean country?  Lorena's Response Black people are not often seen in Buenos Aires.  Argentina was not a country with many immigrants from Africa.  But the blacks that you can see around are mostly from Brazil.  The cultural relationship between Argentina and Brazil is incredibly good.\n",

What I want to point out is that Argentines do not have anything against black people.  They respect them.  I should also let you know that women in Argentina love black men from Brazil, so you won't find racist problems here.  These problems appear not with color, but mainly with \"origin\".  For example, in Argentina they do not accept kindly people coming from Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia.  These people are often treated as inferior.  However, the fact is that this happens because these immigrants come to Argentina without documents and to steal jobs from Argentine citizens.  You could compare this situation to the treatment the Mexicans get who illegally cross into the American southwest.  I can say that, at least for the time I have been living here, I have seen that there are between 5 and 10 different neighborhoods built by different communities: Paraguay, Uruguay, China, Japan, Israel, Greeks, etc, and each community respects the other one.

If the water tastes \"off\" then take the coconut back to the store and get a new one at no cost.  There is another forum on here that goes into detail about it...  I was throwing away purple coconuts and it ends up that they were fine...BUT I did not taste the water first, I just thought, gross, purple coconut and tossed it.\n",

Located on the coasts of the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, both sub-seas of the much larger Mediterranean Sea, Albanian cooking is representative of the widely revered Mediterranean cuisine.  This particular cooking style has been recognized as the healthiest diet in the world for years.  What Is Albanian Food?  Like the renowned Mediterranean diet, Albanian cuisine is primarily based on healthy ingredients such as vegetables, fruit, fish, and seafood.  Olive oil is the most popular—and by far the oldest, dating from Roman times—cooking fat used in traditional Albanian dishes.  Herbs are widely used as well, adding distinct and delicious flavor to food in Albania.  Garlic is a staple, as are onions, which may be the most popular ingredients in the entire country.  Meats like beef, lamb, pork, and poultry are common ingredients in meals, too.  They are, however, not necessarily a part of all traditional Albanian food recipes.  Albanian cuisine has its fair share of vegetarian dishes.  History Of Albanian Food Historically, the openness of the Albanian culture has always resulted in the combination of gastronomy and hospitality.  Being welcoming and friendly is a fundamental aspect of Albanian society, whether it’s to friends or strangers.\n",

This ancient behavioral code dictates that people should always look after guests as well as they can.  Sharing food is, of course, an integral—if not the best—part of that.  Some Albanian ingredients go back thousands of years.  Olive oil, as mentioned earlier, dates from Roman times and is still as popular as it ever was.  Much of the present-day Albanian food culture is younger, though.  Modern dishes have their roots in the Ottoman Empire, and Turkish influences are quite noticeable.  Other modern-day culinary influences include Italian and Greek.  Regional Differences In Albanian Dishes In culinary terms, there are three distinct regions in Albania: north, central, and south.  Northern Albanian Food In northern Albania, you’ll find traditional Albanian food to have its origins both in the mountains and on the coast, as well as in rural areas.  This results in varied cuisine, where lots of different fruits and (root) vegetables are used.  Main staples here include potatoes, carrots, onions, cabbage, beans, garlic, and nuts.  The most popular ingredient, however, is corn (maize).\n",

But beyond the ever-popular Tex-Mex favorites and San Francisco-style burritos that are actually a modern product of cultural integration in the USA, there’s a wildly variable food landscape in Mexico that deserves more of our attention.  There are seven important regions that you should know if you’re interested in learning more about Mexican cuisine.  Due to their geography and history, each region’s food has distinctive characteristics, varying in everything from staple crops to the spices used to season dishes.  Learning about the food in different regions can help you get a better understanding of what Mexican cuisine is really comprised of – and perhaps inspire you to go out and try something new.  Northern Mexico A strong ranching tradition means that beef is king in Northern Mexico.  Harkening back to those days on the range, grilling is a popular method of cooking.  Hearty staples like refried pinto beans, rice, and dried beef are also popular.  The region’s wide variety of cheeses is also a result of the cattle industry.  Wheat cultivation has led flour tortillas to be popular in the area.\n",

In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province.  The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city.

It is recorded under the archives of Aragonese that Catalan missionaries and Jesuits arriving in Cagliari (Sardinia) under the Crown of Aragon, after its capture from the Pisans in 1324 established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city.  The hill was known to them as \"Bonaira\" (or \"Bonaria\" in Sardinian language), as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city (the castle area), which is adjacent to swampland.  During the siege of Cagliari, the Catalans built a sanctuary to the Virgin Mary on top of the hill.  In 1335, King Alfonso the Gentle donated the church to the Mercedarians, who built an abbey that stands to this day.  In the years after that, a story circulated, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously helped to calm a storm in the Mediterranean Sea.  The statue was placed in the abbey.\n",

Tango was initially developed by fusing European, African, and Native South American dance styles.  Originally thought of as a seductive and scandalous dance for the poor and underprivileged Tango was mainly performed in the brothels and streets of Buenos Aires.  Throughout its history, Tango was outlawed and forbidden for several decades due to a coup and subsequent military-run government between 1955 – 1983.  During the 1980s and the following decades, Tango saw a resurgence in popularity throughout Argentina.  Likewise, before and during its suppression in Argentina, Tango’s popularity spread overseas to Europe.  Numerous influences of European and native cultures gave birth to the origins of Tango, which continues to evolve today.  #4 Steak Argentinian steak is known for its exquisite taste throughout the world rarely requires seasoning.

The controller is simply the organization or person who disposes of personal data for myriad possible reasons: for marketing, for human resources, for scientific research, for customer service, well, pretty much for everything you can imagine.\n",

The place of the data controller In a sense a controller is a processor because simply using personal data or storing them which all organizations do, even if only temporary, already fall under the extremely broad definition of processing personal data (and the fact a controller ‘has’ them means he acquired them one way or the other, depending on the purpose and context, with acquiring also being processing).  Still, with processors, as we saw, the GDPR means organizations or individuals who are tasked with one or more processing activities within a contractual agreement.  So the relationship between controller and processor is simply one of conducting business whereby you can’t do everything yourself and, as a controller, de facto use many processors to get things done and be able to do what you need to do.  In the grand scheme of GDPR things you could say there is some kind of a hierarchy.\n",

When a data processor wants to work with sub-processors this can only be done when the data controller knows and agrees.  There are very strict rules in this regard and the data controller has the lead.  Obviously, depending on the scope, processors work with several controllers, controllers also do business with controllers and controllers also process personal data (and can be controller and processor at the same time too).  In that hierarchical view we’d have to put the data subject, people, at the bottom but that would be a bit weird as the GDPR is about the protection of rights and freedoms of data subjects.

Home » All » By Theme » Empanadas » Empanadas mendocinas {Argentinian empanadas} Empanadas mendocinas {Argentinian empanadas} By Layla Pujol 121 Comments Empanadas mendocinas are traditional Argentinean baked empanadas filled with beef, onions, paprika, hot pepper powder, cumin, oregano, hard-boiled egg and olives.  Rebecca of From Argentina With Love is having an empanada of the month event and if you’ve visited my blog before you know that I love empanadas and am always looking for new recipes to try.  The empanada recipe for this month is the empanada mendocina from the Mendoza region in Argentina (also known for great wines).  While empanada mendocinas are very famous, I have never made them before.  So this was a great opportunity to learn how to make them and what makes them different from other meat filled baked empanadas.  I started with Rebecca’s recipe for the meat filling or picadillo.\n",

I wanted to learn what makes these empanadas so special and found out that when it comes to the filling you can make them either with ground beef or chopped beef.  Also the empanadas mendocinas are known for not using raisins- which are common in other types of empanadas – and to finish the smoked paprika and picante or hot pepper are very important.  In addition to the flavor, they give the meat a bright red coloring that is considered a distinguishing factor for empanadas mendocinas.

That may be good news for grain farmers, but it's not a welcome change for the chefs of Buenos Aires.  \"It's politics, not gastronomy,\" says Javier Urondo, chef and owner of Urondo Bar and Restaurant in the Parque Chacubuco neighborhood.  Urondo would much rather buy grass-fed beef, but says it's impossible because the industry doesn't identify meat by production method.  \"There's no way of knowing,\" the affable 54-year-old told me over a late lunch at Bar Seis in the Palermo Soho neighborhood.  \"Even my butcher doesn't know.\"  And because the change has been gradual, Urondo says, most customers don't notice the difference.  (That thought was seconded in a September report on Argentina's beef production by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service.)  Dan Perlman, an American chef and writer living in Buenos Aires who runs his own \"secret\" restaurant, Casa SaltShaker, has also noticed the difference.\n",

Nancy Shute/NPR How exactly does grass-fed beef taste difference from grain-fed beef?  As NPR's Allison Aubrey has reported, the meat from cows that dine on grass may be chewier and less fatty.  She also cites a recent analysis from the Union of Concerned Scientists that found that grass-fed steak has about twice as many omega-3s as a typical grain-fed steak.  The flavor used to be a selling point for Argentina, which has a long, proud history as the world's great exporter of beef, starting way back in the 1800s.  But in recent years Argentina has ceded that crown to Brazil.  Government policies are also helping shrink the country's beef exports.  For years, the price of beef was kept artificially low to encourage domestic consumption.  But that didn't suit the cattlemen too well.\n",

Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla applied the same idea to Buenos Aires in a set of tangos, called the Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas, The adjective “Porteñas” refers to Buenos Aires, hence the English title of The Four Seasons of Buenos Aires.  Piazzolla’s set of four tunes evoking each time of year, composed in the late 1960s for his quintet of piano, bandoneón, violin, electric guitar, and bass (he often used one of the movements to open his concerts).  Piazzolla’s Four Seasons are a series of single tango movements with several references to Vivaldi’s famous work, were not originally conceived as a suite.  First, he composed Verano Porteño (Summer movement) in 1965 as incidental music for the play Melenita de Oro by Alberto Rodríguez Muñoz.  Piazzolla also immediately created an arrangement of the piece for Aníbal Troilo traditional tango orchestra that was recorded in 1967.\n",

Latin American music was not really considered before Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla (1921- 1992), who was the first composer that incorporated improvisation in tango, but his music is different than jazz, he only took the idea of improvisation when he lived in New York from 1924 to 1937 and applied it to his music.  Piazzolla was regarded as tango’s savior, the signature dance of his native country, Argentina.  He was also a bandoneón player, studied with the great 20th century classical figures Alberto Ginastera and Nadia Boulanger, joined the popular tango orchestra of Anibal Troilo before started to compose own music and made a revolution with the tango.  Thanks to him, classical music for Argentina was known in the world.  However, traditional tango lovers resented him a lot.  Even today they consider it not tango.\n",

What many people don’t realize is that dinner is not the main meal of the day in Spain.  Image adapted from infoalimentacion.com  Although it’s recommended that the Spanish eat 5 meals a day, with busy schedules and modern work hours, few people maintain that kind of routine.  To give you an idea of the guidelines as well as what people actually eat, we’ve described each of the 5 suggested meals below… Desayuno: El desayuno is the first meal of the day and is the meal that most often gets skipped.  Breakfast in Spain is fairly light for adults, consisting of coffee and toast or a biscuit, if it’s eaten it at all.  Almuerzo (also media mañana): Theoretically, the intent of this meal is to serve as a snack that rounds out breakfast and keeps you energized until lunch, which is later in Spain than in many other countries.\n",

Some people have both a desayuno and almuerzo, those who skip desayuno might have a more substantial almuerzo, and depending on the person, it might be normal to skip both altogether.  Jamón on toasted bread with tomato is a popular morning meal in Spain Comida : La comida is the main meal in the Spanish diet, similar to dinner in other countries, and takes place around 2:00pm.  It is becoming more common that places open for lunch around 1:00pm, but it’s not yet the norm.  La comida usually consists of several courses and many restaurants offer a menú del día at this time.  Depending on who you talk to, this meal is also called el almuerzo, referring to lunch rather than a mid-morning snack.  If you eat by the book, you’re meals up until this point will be spaced every few hours; desayuno around 8:00am, el almuerzo around 11:00am, and la comida around 2:00pm.  Merienda : La merienda is common among children and is basically an afternoon snack intended to give your kids some energy between lunch and dinner time.\n",

As kids grow up and start managing their own eating habits and schedules, the merienda is eaten with less frequency.  a bocadillo of cured Spanish sausage makes a simple and satisfying merienda Cena: The final meal in the Spanish day is la cena, or dinner.  Dinner in Spain is lighter than la comida but can also consist of multiple courses.  Traditionally, la cena takes places around 10:00pm.  With schedules evolving, some people have begun to have a merienda-cena, which just means they have a final meal at an earlier time rather than an evening snack and then dinner.  Still, if you go out to eat around 8:30pm, when restaurants open for dinner, even popular places will be practically empty.  Although replacing dinner with a merienda-cena is not typical, it is an economical option that gives your body some extra time to digest your food before going to bed.  The New Merienda: an After-school Snack Made Over It used to be the case that only children and older generations had a merienda on a regular basis.  Lately, young and fashionable Spaniards are embracing this evening tentempié (snack) to the point that it has become a thing.\n",

This is a tradition rooted in the colonial period, when the centre of each neighbourhood was a general store and bar known as a pulpería.  These neighbourhoods provide a sense of community for people who live in an urban sprawl that by the early 21st century was growing twice as fast as the country as a whole.

PewDiePie is the most subscribed YouTuber with “40 Million Subscribers” (11th November 2015).  He is on average gaining 1/2 million new subscribers every month and had literally transformed himself from ‘a nobody‘ into a ‘youtube celebrity‘ into an ‘actual celebrity‘.  The real question is: Who was PewDiePie’s first subscriber?  He makes money by playing video games.  That’s not entirely true.  At this point, you’ve definitely heard of ‘Felix(Arvid Ulf)Kjellberg’from Sweden (aka PewDiePie) who earns an average of £7 million a year (just from video ad revenue).   Felix produces 2-4 episodes of entertainment everyday that can take the good part of a day to produce.  There is a debate as to whether or not he deserves such a large amount of money for, as some people put it, just playing video games.\n",

($144m) Let’s think about this logically.   A 30 second advertisement during the super bowlcosts £3mand so essentially the companies are paying £3m for their advert to be seen by 114 million people.  So if we divide 3,000,000 by 114,000,000 we get £26,315.78which is the exact figure that companies are paying the superbowl’s TV network per 1 millionviews.  Felix get’s an average of 10m views across his videos every day and so if we times £26,315.78by 10we get £263,157.8meaning a television advert with 10 million viewswould cost £263,000however PewDiePie is only being paid between £1.9K – £29.6K for a 10 million view advert.  So the overall point that I’m trying to make is that YouTuber’s are under paid.  Many advertisers perceive online adverts to be less valuable than adverts on the dying medium known as television.   Even if he was paid ITV’s pricehe’d be earning 18 million a year which is still over double what he’s earning now.\n",

It’s an extremely small pay check but he’s selling enough fish to feed his family and he loves selling fishso he’s happy.  One day the popularity of fish has a massive boost and he starts selling tens of thousands of fish a day.  He’s now a millionaire but he still sells fish for 20p.  YouTube is cluttered with young kids trying to upload their gameplay commentaries and then questioning the system when they don’t succeed.   The amount of 12 year olds that I’ve seen mumbling over a ‘Minecraft‘ clip about what block their swinging their virtual axe at would surprise you.   The average ‘youtube celebrity’ is in his 20s and it’s very rare that you’ll see a successful youtuber under the age of 16.   The biggest YouTubers today are people who got in the game early.\n",

Jeanne takes a gun from a drawer.  She tells Paul her name and shoots him.  Paul staggers out onto the balcony, mortally wounded, and collapses.

Shamefully, I’ve been doing something similar for 25 years.  Despite living in Buenos Aires – the cradle of Argentine tango – for a decade and revisiting time and again, and, even, learning to love the music of Astor Piazzolla and other legendary maestros, I never took to the floor.  Why?  A long story.  But I think I can put it down to an oversensitivity to others’ irony.  As an expat in my 20s and 30s I had the kinds of male friends who dissed any kind of social life other than steaks, booze, clubbing, and banter.  I was young, repressed, ignorant.\n",

In October I went back to Buenos Aires, aged 51, with the sole aim of taking up the challenge of becoming a man at ease with his dancing self and thus being initiated into the temple of tango: the milonga (dance floor).  But tango is uniquely challenging, as was proved to me when I invited a lissom Argentine woman to take a turn with me at a club called Chau Che Clú.  I was fresh from a class, in which Nati, my teacher, nodded approvingly at my posture, my “not so English” sense of rhythm and my enthusiasm.

I smiled at her and confessed, self-deprecatingly, “I’m a beginner.  What about you?”  She looked up and smiled.  “Más o menos.”  More or less.  The standard tango set is three songs, known as a tanda – almost 10 minutes of dancing, an epoch of errors and false moves while worrying about what she might mean.  When I sat down, I felt relief.  But only momentarily, for, as I took my first sip of malbec, I saw my relinquished dance partner accepting an invite from a hoary old tanguero.  They moved together as one.  They talked – in silence.  They were cheeky and yet chaste.  They were perfect, more or less.  My reinvention involved the mind as well as the body.  I stayed in a tango-themed bedroom at the Legado Mítico hotel.  I visited the Museo Mundial del Tango, located above the venerable Café Tortoni.\n",

First, it’s refreshing to get substantive, thoughtful answers from someone who may have presidential aspirations.  It is easy to forget what serious public servants should sound like.  Second, Warren is clearly on the progressive end of the scale, championing tariffs if needed, an increase in the minimum wage and more financial regulations.  What is intriguing, however, is that she presents these as correctives to market failure.  We can debate whether her prescriptions are appropriate.  But she’s not attacking capitalism per se, nor the importance of functioning markets.  And third, her emphasis on market concentration and monopolies has been echoed by conservatives and moderates.\n",

Below I then discuss her responses in greater detail.  Question 1: What constitutes “theft’ and “cheating”?  Are we talking about insider trading or something more endemic to markets?  Sure, it includes insider trading — but it’s a lot more than that.  In a well-functioning market, companies compete by providing better products, better service, or better prices.  That kind of competition benefits customers and rewards businesses that out-innovate or out-work their competitors.  But when companies can deceive their customers about the quality or price of their products, that’s cheating — and the market stops working.\n",

That’s bad for customers and bad for the companies that just want to do the right thing.  In order to reap the benefits of competitive markets it is critical to crack down on cheating.  That was the idea behind the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Before the financial crisis, the market for financial products was broken.  To take just one of many examples, lenders could sell teaser-rate mortgages deliberately designed to obscure both the risks and the costs for borrowers.  The CFPB created new rules for mortgages that forced companies to compete more visibly on products and service, instead of competing on which company could mislead customers most effectively.  Consumers could make more informed choices and the market began to work better, which benefited both the customers and the businesses that were willing to compete straight up.  Question 2: If markets produce wealth, shouldn’t we be opening markets internationally, increasing free trade and creating new opportunities?  I’m all for trade deals that work for the American people.  But for decades, our system for negotiating and enforcing trade deals has been rigged in favor of massive corporations.\n",

Wise 12.12.16 2 minute read What is PSD2? PSD2 is the second Payment Services Directive, designed by the countries of the European Union.  It could revolutionise the payments industry, affecting everything from the way we pay online, to what information we see when making a payment.  Adapting to the new requirements will need a lot of investment on behalf of the industry - and while some players aren’t happy, it will be good news for consumers.  PSD2 was first brought in at a European level in 2015, but members of the EU have until 2018 to implement it - which is why it matters now.  What are the key changes?  PSD2 will break down the bank’s monopoly on their user’s data.  It will allow ‘merchants’, businesses like Amazon, to retrieve your account data from your bank - with your permission.  That means when you buy something they can make a payment for you, without having to redirect you to another service (like PayPal or Visa).\n",

PSD2 will also require stronger identity checks when paying online.  Like many elements of the directive, the specifics are still being debated - but it’s likely to involve more checks than we currently have, particularly for high value transactions.  How is this relevant to Stop Hidden Fees?  In Spring next year, the UK Parliament will debate the Payment Services Regulations.  These regulations will write PSD2 into UK law, but the Government can decide what is (and isn’t) upheld.  As well as the welcome changes to online payments and direct debits, PSD2 also prohibits the use of non-transparent pricing methods for international payments.  Right now, banks and brokers often hide costs in poor exchange rates, which are much lower than the mid-market rate you’d see on Google.  Most providers only disclose up front fees, either a fixed fee or a percentage of the transfer amount, meaning that customers are surprised with extra fees when the exchange rate used isn’t the one they’re expecting.\n",

This means banks and brokers can still hide charges in bad exchange rates, which are much lower than the mid-market rate you’d see on Google, XE.com or Reuters.

Moreover, the trend has gained support from the EU government.

Platforms as a service One of the FinTech predictions 2020 is the boost of PaaS (Platform as a Service) solutions that go beyond the cloud.  Old and good PaaS based on cloud computing technologies lets companies extend the ready-made solutions and add custom developments to satisfy their business needs.  Conventional PaaS worked great for the FinTech industry as providers took the job on configuring and maintaining applications freeing up developers’ time on coding tasks.  Today, PaaS vendors take even more responsibility offering solutions for team collaboration, tools for streamlining deployment, services on configuration and resource management.  With these core areas handed over to PaaS providers, other business processes in the financial sector like budget planning, credit risk management, payments processing, billings, client service are going to be delegated as well.

However, entry into the crypto market can be intimidating for new investors.  Indeed, crypto investing is not like stock market investing or any other kind of investing.  In fact, I argue that crypto investing shouldn’t be considered an investment, but rather a speculation.  I’ve written more about this opinion here at Stocks Vs Crypto Investing .  Is Crypto an investment a speculation or a gamble?  Why? #BTC #ETH #Crypto #stocks — JC Keen (@Cash_Keen) February 10, 2021 Before jumping into crypto investing, it is important to understand that when you invest in crypto you are not investing in a company, like you do when you invest in stocks.  In addition, crypto investing does not have the same regulatory protections stock investors are familiar with.  Finally, crypto investing is highly risky and volatile.  Given all of this, crypto beginner investors must take certain precautions to protect their hard-earned capital.\n",

This is obviously not the case.  Not only do cryptocurrency prices go down, but also, an overwhelming number of cryptocurrencies fail.  Perhaps you’ve heard the term “dead coins.”  These are cryptocurrency projects that were launched with huge expectations, but ultimately died and left their investors with nothing but losses.  Related: More than 1,000 coins have failed Some of these dead coins were probably scams from the beginning.  Others were probably unserious projects, projects with lack of funding, projects lacking the right management, etc.  In many cases, crypto investors rushed to buy these coins only to see the value of these coins drop to zero.\n",

By the end of 2018 I had seen the value of my Ethereum investment drop by 96% in just over a year.  The good thing is I held on to my investment and now it has provided me with a 6X return.  Tip #2 – Never Borrow Money to Buy Crypto As far as I can tell most, if not all, cryptocurrency exchanges allow clients to purchase crypto using margin.  Margin allows the investor to borrow money to purchase additional crypto, while using the investor’s existing balance as collateral.  The problem with this is if the value of the investment goes down a certain percentage, the investor will be forced to sell to cover the loan.  This is called a margin call.  Below is some language from Coinbase, pertaining the use of margin: If your loan health falls below 40%, you’ll typically have 72 hours to add BTC collateral or make a payment.  In the rare case that your loan health falls below 15% (where the value of BTC drops dramatically), Coinbase will sell off just enough of your BTC collateral to bring your loan health back to 50%, plus 2% of the total transaction, without prior notice.\n",

With so many different types of brokers and exchanges to choose from these days, it can be more than difficult to find the platform that best fits your trading needs.  Selecting a good trading platform can make or break your portfolio.  It pays to choose one carefully.  To make things easier, I compared several of the top trading platforms available in Europe and laid out the best ones below, along with some key points to keep in mind and some of the benefits and drawbacks of each.  I believe in a neutral market where people should trade what they like based on careful research.  For this reason, I selected the best trading platform for traditional assets classes like stocks, ETFs, indices, options, forex, but also included the top ones for cryptocurrency trading.  Now among the top 15 market caps worldwide, it would be unfair to still exclude Bitcoin and Ethereum exchanges.\n",

Founding member Palmer's departure from the project came unexpectedly in 2015.  Rather than talking about the theory of the decentralised, distributed digital currency blockchain, he said he concentrated on the practical and technical aspects of the underlying technology.  In the last few days of December 2015, one Dogecoin was worth four thousandths of a penny.  Consensus and Tokenomics Taking development cues from Tenebrix and Litecoin, Dogecoin currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt.  with a target time interval of one minute after every block, with no difficulty adjustment.  When blocks have been mined, the number of coins received per block halves.  In the beginning, 10,000 Dogecoin will be rewarded to the 600,000th block.  Block rewards were envisioned with the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number as an integral factor and the outcome of the block schedule multiplier as a Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number.  Difficulty readjustment mechanism was altered from every four hours to one block to every minute, in order to better handle abrupt rises and falls in network hash rate.\n",

However, its active mining community is one of the reasons it continues to operate and trade.  DOGE is merged mined with Litecoin.  Essentially, practically everyone who mines Litecoin (LTC) chooses to mine Dogecoin as well, because merge mining Dogecoin increases profits.  Dogecoin hash rate is roughly 150 TH/s. This is just below the Litecoin (LTC) hash rate of 170 TH/s. Price action Until 2017, however, Dogecoin did not go through the $0.0024 price until later that year.  Due to this, consumers acquired more coins, and the value of the altcoin gained ground.  At the time, the price varied considerably and peaked at $0.003 USD in the spring of 2017.  I was rather surprised when DOGE reached 0.007 at the end of 2017.  On an optimistic note, DOGE did not move more than 0.007 throughout the first year of the year of 2021 Until the beginning of April, it maintained a consistent pattern.

The reusable launch system technology was developed and initially used for the first stage of Falcon 9.  After stage separation, the booster flips around, an optional boostback burn is done to reverse its course, a reentry burn, controlling direction to arrive at the landing site and a landing burn to effect the final low-altitude deceleration and touchdown.  SpaceX intended (from at least 2014) to develop technology to extend reusable flight hardware to second stages, a more challenging engineering problem because the vehicle is travelling at orbital velocity.Second stage reuse is considered paramount to Elon Musk's plans to enable the settlement of Mars.

What is the difference between a Olds 350 Rocket and a regular Olds 350.  I have a 70 Cutlass S and, while it doesn't much matter now since the motor has been professionally built to the way I wanted it, I I'm still curious if it is a Rocket or not.  I've heard that the more powerful ones are the rocket, while some people say they just call the olds 350's rockets.  I'm assuming mine was the base 250 hp 350 since I had to change a few things to put it up to the 350 hp range.  Could somebody tell me what the real difference is?  MrPbody 02-22-2006, 12:45 PM Brutus, Most of the \"Rocket\" engines I've seen were 4-bbl.  carbs.  I believe the biggest difference between them are the air cleaner housing and valve covers.\n",

This broad definition includes airbreathing jet engines (turbojets, turbofans, ramjets, and pulse jets).  In general, jet engines are combustion engines.   In common parlance the term \"jet engine\" is used only for airbreathing jet engines.  These typically feature a rotating air compressor powered by a turbine, with the leftover power providing thrust via a propelling nozzle – this process is known as the Brayton thermodynamic cycle.  Jet aircraft use such engines for long-distance travel.  Early jet aircraft used turbojet engines that were relatively inefficient for subsonic flight.  Most modern subsonic jet aircraft use more complex high-bypass turbofan engines.  They give higher speed and greater fuel efficiency than piston and propeller aeroengines over long distances.  A few air-breathing engines made for high speed applications (ramjets and scramjets) use the ram effect of the vehicle's speed instead of a mechanical compressor.   The thrust of a typical jetliner engine went from (de Havilland Ghost turbojet) in the 1950s to (General Electric GE90 turbofan) in the 1990s, and their reliability went from 40 in-flight shutdowns per 100,000 engine flight hours to less than 1 per 100,000 in the late 1990s.\n",

Section::::History.   Jet engines date back to the invention of the aeolipile before the first century AD.  This device directed steam power through two nozzles to cause a sphere to spin rapidly on its axis.  It was seen as a curiosity.   Jet propulsion only gained practical applications with the invention of the gunpowder-powered rocket by the Chinese in the 13th century as a type of firework, and gradually progressed to propel formidable weaponry.  Jet propulsion technology then stalled for hundreds of years.   The earliest attempts at airbreathing jet engines were hybrid designs in which an external power source first compressed air, which was then mixed with fuel and burned for jet thrust.  The Caproni Campini N.1, and the Japanese Tsu-11 engine intended to power Ohka kamikaze planes towards the end of World War II were unsuccessful.    Even before the start of World War II, engineers were beginning to realize that engines driving propellers were approaching limits due to issues related to propeller efficiency, which declined as blade tips approached the speed of sound.  If aircraft performance were to increase beyond such a barrier, a different propulsion mechanism was necessary.\n",

The key to a practical jet engine was the gas turbine, extracting power from the engine itself to drive the compressor.  The gas turbine was not a new idea: the patent for a stationary turbine was granted to John Barber in England in 1791.  The first gas turbine to successfully run self-sustaining was built in 1903 by Norwegian engineer Ægidius Elling.  Such engines did not reach manufacture due to issues of safety, reliability, weight and, especially, sustained operation.   The first patent for using a gas turbine to power an aircraft was filed in 1921 by Maxime Guillaume.  His engine was an axial-flow turbojet, but was never constructed, as it would have required considerable advances over the state of the art in compressors.  Alan Arnold Griffith published \"An Aerodynamic Theory of Turbine Design\" in 1926 leading to experimental work at the RAE.   In 1928, RAF College Cranwell cadet Frank Whittle formally submitted his ideas for a turbojet to his superiors.  In October 1929 he developed his ideas further.  On 16 January 1930 in England, Whittle submitted his first patent (granted in 1932).  The patent showed a two-stage axial compressor feeding a single-sided centrifugal compressor.\n",

A liquid-propellant rocket or liquid rocket utilizes a rocket engine that uses liquid propellants.  Liquids are desirable because they have a reasonably high density and high specific impulse (I sp ).  This allows the volume of the propellant tanks to be relatively low.  It is also possible to use lightweight centrifugal turbopumps to pump the rocket propellant from the tanks into the combustion chamber, which means that the propellants can be kept under low pressure.  This permits the use of low-mass propellant tanks that do not need to resist the high pressures needed to store significant amounts of gases, resulting in a low mass ratio for the rocket.\n",

Goddard launched a vehicle using liquid oxygen and gasoline as propellants.  The rocket, which was dubbed \"Nell\", rose just 41 feet during a 2.5-second flight that ended in a cabbage field, but it was an important demonstration that rockets utilizing liquid propulsion were possible.  Goddard proposed liquid propellants about fifteen years earlier and began to seriously experiment with them in 1921.  The German-Romanian Hermann Oberth published a book in 1922 suggesting the use of liquid propellants.  In Germany, engineers and scientists became enthralled with liquid propulsion, building and testing them in the early 1930s in a field near Berlin.

The force is applied typically to pistons, turbine blades, rotor or a nozzle.  This force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into useful mechanical energy.   The first commercially successful internal combustion engine was created by Étienne Lenoir around 1859 and the first modern internal combustion engine was created in 1876 by Nikolaus Otto (see \"Otto engine\").   The term \"internal combustion engine\" usually refers to an engine in which combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine.  A second class of internal combustion engines use continuous combustion: gas turbines, jet engines and most rocket engines, each of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously described.

Barsanti and Matteucci obtained other patents for the same invention in France, Belgium and Piedmont between 1857 and 1859.In 1860, Belgian Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir produced a gas-fired internal combustion engine.  In 1864, Nikolaus Otto patented the first atmospheric gas engine.  In 1872, American George Brayton invented the first commercial liquid-fuelled internal combustion engine.  In 1876, Nikolaus Otto, working with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, patented the compressed charge, four-cycle engine.\n",

I will get to your question about space shuttle vs rockets towards the end, when you understand the terminology to parse my answer.  Here are some more details of what the parts are.  Space Vehicle The whole thing which gets you to space.  The space shuttle is a type of space vehicle, but so was the Saturn V and Falcon 9.  Space Craft This is typically the payload of the space vehicle.  It is what you launch into space.  The payload could be satellite or just about anything.  If it can move around with its own rocket engines, we typically refer to it as a space craft.  The part with the wings on that landed back on earth, when the space shuttle was launched was called the orbiter.  The orbiter was a space plane, and a space plane is a type of space craft.\n",

                            "text": "\nUnlike “regular” space crafts a space plane can enter the atmosphere and land like a plane. Launch Vehicle Take away the payload (space craft) from the space vehicle and you got the launch vehicle.  Typically the launch vehicle is a multi-stage rocket.  Meaning it is composed of multiple rockets.  Together these rockets give the ability to launch a payload from a planetary surface into orbit.  Rocket In my more specific definition used here, a rocket is simple a single stage within a launch vehicle, which has propellant tanks and rocket engines.  The payload of a single stage rocket is typically another rocket, in a multi-stage rocket setup.  Is Reusability the Key Difference?  So it is not true as some claim here that the difference between a rocket and a space shuttle is reusability.  In the very generic use of the word rocket, the space shuttle IS a “rocket”.  But from my explanation above it should be clear that the comparison does not make any sense.  The space shuttle is a form of space vehicle which just like other space vehicles such as the Saturn V or Falcon 9 contains multiple rockets.  What makes the space shuttle different from other space vehicles, is that its space craft, the orbiter, is a space plane which can land back on earth.\n",

Thank you for tuning in for this special dual-interview as part of our Corals Week.  I'm your host, Kate Nielsen.  Today we will explore ocean acidification and coral bleaching.  A special welcome today to Jennifer Koss, the Acting Director for NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program, and Mark Eakin, the Coordinator for NOAA's Coral Reef Watch.  Hi Jennifer and Mark, thanks for joining us today!  JENNIFER KOSS:  Thanks for having us.  MARK EAKIN: Great to be here.  HOST:  Jennifer, I asked your colleague, John Christensen this question last year on Diving Deeper when we interviewed him, so it's a good opportunity to see where we stand today.  What can you tell us about the health of our coral reefs now in 2014?  JENNIFER KOSS:  Well, I wish I could say that overall things were improving, but unfortunately that's just not the case.\n",

We had bleaching events in both the main eight islands as well as Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and Guam, Florida, a few places reported internationally as well; and in the Florida Keys it’s the worst bleaching incident we've seen since 1998.  And then in general the local stressors that corals experience are still there and the global stressors continue to increase.  HOST:  Can you expand on what you mean when you say these stressors that our corals face today?  JENNIFER KOSS:  Another word for stressors would be threats.  The Coral Program tends to define the threats as local and global and the local threats are kind of impacts from land-based sources of pollution as well as impacts from fishing.  And the fishing in general, globally-speaking, a lot of our fisheries are either exploited to the max if not over-exploited.  It's not quite the case in the United States, but if you're looking worldwide that's certainly the case.\n",

And then gear impacts can be everything from literally colliding with a coral reef to people who dynamite fish or cyanide fish and it's kind of more adding insult to injury there; and then our other big local impact would be land-based sources of pollution and that can be anything from sediment coming off of the land to nutrients and toxins coming off the land and then the plastics that seem to be increasing and becoming more globally distributed.  And then global impacts, which Mark will talk far more about, would be all of the impacts from climate change so warming sea water temperatures, sea level rise, ocean acidification.  HOST:  So, unfortunately it is quite the host of threats that our corals are seeing.  I think for today's episode I'd like to look a little bit more at this effect of warming waters on our corals and I'll open that up to both of you to chime in.  JENNIFER KOSS:\n",

This is how it’s been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence.  However, as humans took over the planet, we’ve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earth’s resources – including a vital resource known as coral reefs.  So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly?  Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time.  Coral reefs don’t normally die by natural means.  In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue.  However, corals are not immortal, since they can die as a result of bleaching or being severely damaged.\n",

Despite these facts, it has been estimated that some corals may have been around for thousands of years without going through bleaching or death.  In the natural world, before global warming or pollution began to destroy the natural balance of our planet, coral reefs were damaged or bleached only on rare occasions.  A few natural catastrophes like the event that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs have also destroyed coral reefs, but they have always returned.  That is because coral larvae often survive and attach themselves to rocks or old limestone formations preciously created by their predecessors, and continue to grow and create new structures.  Corals have faced extinction in the past, and they have pulled through it.  A good example is the Late Devonian Extinction, a natural catastrophe that has hit the marine environment hard, leading to the disappearance of species we know today as “stony” corals for many millions of years.  Nevertheless, coral reefs have returned time and time again.  Is this period of global warming any different, and should we really expect the complete annihilation of coral reefs?\n",

Okay, we have to start from this, below here they are the 20 threats to ocean ecosystems : 1.  Overfishing in the Ocean Fishermen are one of the livelihoods that until now still in demand.  However, some of them in catching their fish do things that even destroying marine ecosystems, such as using trawlers or fishing by boat with large nets that lead to overfishing.  Do overfishing will have an impact on humans and marine ecosystems.  What will happen?  If humans do overfishing with certain species, this will make the fish is a threat of extinction.  Not only that, by making overfishing we automatically damage the ecosystem in the sea, destroying the physical environment of marine life, and distorting the whole food chain in the oceans.  If the food chain is damaged, the consequences will vibrate up and down to all living organisms that are in the chain food at sea.\n",

Ocean acidification is often expressed in pH which is a measure of acidity and PH below 7 is considered acid.  Some researchers suggest that the average sea water level has fallen by about 0.1 units.  This means that ocean acidification increases by approximately 25% and this will change 10 times faster than the time in the last 55 million years.  Ocean acidification is expected to occur more quickly in temperate or tropical regions.  As with some corals in California, some corals are corrosive.  The impact of ocean acidification is different in species, some algae can use CO2 to increase photosynthesis and its growth rate.  However, in other species such as mollusks, corals and some varieties of plankton will be in danger.  Where in the case of coral reefs, for example, this makes them experience changes in growth, development, and survival in response to ocean acidification.  3. Ozone Depleting Ozone is the colorless gas present in the atmospheric stratosphere where ozone plays a role to protect us from light ultraviolet, harmful sunlight.\n",

One of the worst adverse effects on marine ecosystems is on plankton.  Where plankton plays an important role in the food chain and oceanic carbon cycles.  Several studies have shown that ozone depletion is more likely to change the composition of living organisms at sea level rather than reducing their overall mass.  In addition to plankton, a number of young fish, shrimp, and crabs are also threatened due to ozone depletion.  They will die before reaching their reproductive age.  Less food will be available for adult fish and other higher marine life forms and could lead to a loss of 45% of primary production at sea.  If the ozone depletion is getting bigger, human beings can’t consume fish, because their production is decreasing and the fish will become extinct.  4.  Trawling and dredging Human activities like trawling and dredging give direct and indirect effects to ocean ecosystems.  The activities that direct to ocean ecosystems are killing the population of some species in the ocean and some fishes loss of habitat cause of the destruction of the seafloor.\n",

Corals exist as individual polyps or in colonies.  Eight hundred species of reef-building corals and hundreds of non reef-building corals are known.  Coral polyps live in a relatively narrow band of the Earth's oceans and thrive only in oceans within 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south of the equator.  In these areas, temperatures must average above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and the water must be of a low nutrient quality.  Anatomy Coral polyps are multicellular organisms with limited organ development.  The average polyp grows from 1 to 3mm in diameter and can exist as a solitary individual or as a group of interconnected polyps called a colony.  Colonial polyps are connected by the coenosarc, allowing polyps to communicate and share nutrients.  Similar to cnidarians, polyps contain three body tissues: epidermis, mesoglea, and gastrodermis.  Corals are categorized as scleractinian, also called hard corals, or as Alcyonacea, soft corals, depending on whether or not they produce a calcium carbonate skeleton.  Corals that create a rigid calcium carbonate skeleton are the hard corals.  These are the primary corals involved in reef building and are termed hermatypic.\n",

The tentacles encircle the mouth and are used in defense and the capturing of prey.  They contain stinging cells called nematocysts.  These poison-injecting cells are used to incapacitate small prey, as well as deter predators.  The mouth is the only opening to the gastrovacular cavity and is used to ingest food and expel waste.  The gastovascular cavity contains mesenteries, with internal folds that increase the surface area of the stomach.  Mesenteries are known to contain digestive filaments that aid in food capture.  The mesenteries are supported by septa.  Hard coral polyps attach to the substrate via the calyx and basal plate.  Calcium carbonate is secreted at the base of the animal.  As polyps die, they leave the secreted calcium carbonate skeleton behind.  In living scleractinian coral colonies new polyps will grow in place of the dead polyp.  The buildup of calcium carbonate over time leads to the formation of coral reefs.  Soft coral polyps are similar in structure to those of hard corals.  However, ahermatypic corals do not have calyx, septae, or basal plates and do not secrete calcium carbonate.  The polyps are also characterized as having tentacles and mesenteries grouped into sets of eight.  These corals are often specialized for filter feeding.\n",

Symbiotic relationships can be categorized into three different types including, mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.  The species involved in these relationships are called symbionts.  In a mutualistic symbiotic relationship, both species involved benefit.  An example of this type of relationship is the one between oxpecker birds and rhinos.  An oxpecker bird will land on the back of a rhino and eat the ticks, fleas, and other parasites that live on them.  Both symbionts benefit.  As the oxpecker receives nutrients from eating the parasites, the rhinos are getting rid of the parasites feeding on them.  In many cases the mutualistic symbiotic relationship is obligative meaning that both symbionts rely on the benefits gained so much that without them neither symbiont would survive.  In commensalism one symbiont, called the commensal, benefits from the relationship while the other symbiont, called the host, remains unaffected.  An example of this type of relationship could be when smaller fish follow bigger fish in order to eat leftover food.  The smaller fish benefit by gaining nutrients from the leftover food while the bigger fish are unaffected as they are already done with the food.  Parasitism is a non-mutual symbiotic relationship where the parasite, benefits at the expense of the host.\n",

So, as the planet warms, it's the ocean that gets most of the extra energy.  But if the ocean gets too warm, then the plants and animals that live in it must adapt—or die.  In the ocean, all creatures depend on the supply of plankton (tiny plants and animals) at the bottom of the food chain.  Algae and plankton are at the bottom of the food chain.  Plankton includes many different kinds of tiny animals, plants, or bacteria that just float and drift in the ocean.  Other tiny animals such as krill (sort of like little shrimp) eat the plankton.  Fish and even whales and seals feed on the krill.  In some parts of the ocean, krill populations have dropped by over 80 percent.  Why?  Krill like to breed in really cold water near sea ice.  What would happen if there were no sea ice?  What would happen if there were very little plankton or krill?  The whole food web could come unraveled.  Coral is another ocean creature in trouble.  Coral is a very fragile animal that builds a shell around itself.\n",

They share the food with the coral, and, in turn, the coral gives the algae a safe and sunny place to live.  The two of them get along fine, living in clean, clear, shallow waters where the Sun shines through brightly.  Fish love coral too, because there are lots of nooks and crannies for them to hide in.  But the algae cannot carry out photosynthesis in water that is too warm.  The algae either die, or the coral spits it out.  Scientists are not sure exactly what happens, but it's bad for the algae, the coral, and the fish.  The corals lose their colorful food sources and become weak.  This sad event is called coral bleaching, and it is happening on a grand scale in many places around the world.  How does the ocean soak up CO 2? Fish and other animals in the ocean breathe oxygen and give off carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), just like land animals.  Ocean plants take in the carbon dioxide and give off oxygen, just like land plants.

Coral bleaching happens when corals lose their vibrant colors and turn white.  But there’s a lot more to it than that.  Coral are bright and colorful because of microscopic algae called zooxanthellae.  The zooxanthellae live within the coral in a mutually beneficial relationship, each helping the other survive.  But when the ocean environment changes—if it gets too hot, for instance—the coral stresses out and expels the algae.  As the algae leaves, the coral fades until it looks like it’s been bleached.  If the temperature stays high, the coral won’t let the algae back, and the coral will die.  Protect Coral Reefs You can help protect coral reefs, too.  Climate change poses a fundamental threat to coral reefs.  Simple steps such as carpooling to work or using mass transit can help reduce your carbon footprint and protect these vibrant ecosystems.

Coral may bleach for other reasons, like extremely low tides, pollution, or too much sunlight.  Why does coral bleaching matter?  Coral bleaching matters because once these corals die, reefs rarely come back.  With few corals surviving, they struggle to reproduce, and entire reef ecosystems, on which people and wildlife depend, deteriorate.  Bleaching also matters because it’s not an isolated phenomenon.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, between 2014 and 2017 around 75% of the world’s tropical coral reefs experienced heat-stress severe enough to trigger bleaching.  For 30% of the world’s reefs, that heat-stress was enough to kill coral.  The Impacts © Jürgen Freund / WWF How does coral bleaching impact wildlife?  Coral reefs support some of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet.  Thousands of marine animals depend on coral reefs for survival, including some species of sea turtles, fish, crabs, shrimp, jellyfish, sea birds, starfish, and more.  Coral reefs provide shelter, spawning grounds, and protection from predators.  They also support organisms at the base of ocean food chains.\n",

Coral bleaching impacts peoples’ livelihoods, food security, and safety.  Coral reefs are natural barriers that absorb the force of waves and storm surges, keeping coastal communities safe.  Without them, we must rely on manmade seawalls that are expensive, less effective, and environmentally damaging to construct.  Bleached coral also compounds the overfishing crisis by removing links in the food web and depriving some fish and crustacean species of a place to spawn and develop.  Anyone relying on these animals as a primary source of income or protein will be in trouble.  Finally, reef tourism brings in billions of dollars each year and supports thousands of jobs.

And one of the biggest challenges of bicycle travel is covering surprisingly large distances under our own power, while carrying everything we need with us.  Thus it’s no surprise that bike travel discussions so often make their way to the subject of gear, even though we all know the gear is just there to enable the experience.  Sometimes finding ways to carry all that stuff on a bicycle is darn hard!  These days bike travel has evolved into two distinct styles, with two typical gear-toting setups: traditional rack and pannier touring, and bikepacking with… you guessed it, bikepacking bags.  Both are effective ways to carry everything you need for days, weeks, or even months.  But their strengths and weaknesses will be revealed differently on different types of bike trips.\n",

Panniers versus Bikepacking Bags First, a quick overview of terms.  What are racks and panniers?  Panniers are bags that attach to racks, which attach to your bike.  They come in left/right pairs, and a full setup includes four: two in back and two in the front, though many people ride with only rear panniers on lighter trips.  A rack and pannier setup typically includes these parts: Rear rack 2 rear panniers Handlebar bag / case Front rack (optional) 2 front panniers (optional) Bicycle travelers often also strap additional bulky items to the rear rack, like a tent or sleeping pad.  Racks and panniers are usually (but not always) associated with the “bicycle touring” style: longer distances or international trips, more and heavier gear, more pavement than dirt, more populated than remote, more motels and established campgrounds than wilderness camping (though this last one is more variable).\n",

To fit all this gear, it’s common for bike tourers to use four panniers (two in the back and two up front) or a trailer, with or without panniers.  Credit-card touring: So-called credit-card touring involves buying meals rather than making them and spending nights in hotels, motels, or bed and breakfasts rather than camping.  This style of bike touring requires you to only pack along clothing, toiletries, snacks and a few extras, all of which will likely fit in two rear or front panniers.  Vehicle-supported touring: Some people enjoy touring with the support of a friend who drives a vehicle loaded with overnight gear and extra food and clothing.

This article primarily discusses how to pack for self-supported bike touring; if you’re preparing for a different type of tour, it’s easy enough to make adjustments to the strategies presented here based on how much stuff you’re bringing along.  How to Pack Panniers Panniers are the go-to storage solution for most bike tourers.  These bags offer roomy storage and are designed to clip onto the sides of front and rear racks and can be quickly removed so you can take the bags with you when you reach a destination.  Many panniers are waterproof, so you don’t have to worry about your things getting wet during a rainy ride; for those that aren’t, consider packing your things in waterproof stuff sacks or using raincovers designed to go over your panniers.  When doing a self-supported tour, you’ll likely need four panniers (two in front and two in back) to fit all your gear, clothing and food.\n",

During the summer I would ride my bike, but it would come in waves without any consistency.  There is one huge hill climb to get to my work that is quite daunting, and is the main reason why most people take a vehicle, especially when you are running late.  One day I said, screw it — I am going to put together an electric bike.\n",

Besides everyone needs a project to work on during the winter or rainy months.  But how would I build a bike?  What motor would I use?  What batteries should I choose?  All these questions and more can help you build your own bike.  Getting Started Photo by Scott D. W. Smith If you type “diy electric bike” in your favorite search engine, you will find a barrage of information from electric drill bikes to the top 10 most expensive electric bikes.  The information can be daunting and lead you in many directions, only to cause confusion with so many choices.  My goal was simple: build an electric bike that everyone can replicate with minimal cost, without electrical know-how, but be powerful and reliable at the same time.  Another major goal was to decrease complexity over other builds, which in turn would make maintenance easier over time.

Traditionally the hub motor has been the most popular choice for electric bikes.  With the hub motor you have two choices, geared hub motors and direct drive motors.  Each type has its own pros and cons which can be viewed here: http://electricbikereport.com/electric-bike-direct-drive-geared-hub-motors/ A relative newcomer to the scene is what is called a mid-drive electric motor.  The mid-drive electric motor is not installed in your front or rear wheel hub, but attached to your front drive system.  The main advantage to this system is the ability to use your own bike’s rear derailleur to change gears.  The motor has its optimum rpm speed which you can sense when riding the bike.  When the chain spins really fast, but your speed doesn’t increase, you simply change to a lower gear in the rear to get the perfect combination.  I chose to use the mid-drive Bafang BBS02 motor kit.\n",

Bike Size Chart – How To Choose?  5 Easy Methods Jeff Balton - Last updated: April 1st, 2021 Ordering bikes online is becoming more and more popular because there are no shop-keeping or warehouse costs making the cost even less!  Don’t worry about the fact that you might think you have to try your bike first because I can assure you it is overrated.  And very highly.  Salesmen only tell you this to get more money from you!  You should try your bike first!  FALSE Asking why?  It’s because that is only told by salesmen who know that there are decent bikes on the online market.  There are many good methods to choose a good bike.  I’m gonna show you THREE (actually SEVEN!)  METHODS if you don’t know, how to measure a bike.  Feeling more confident?  Good.  There are actually three (now SIX!) options: you can calculate or use the bike-size charts below.  The bike size is measured from where the seat post starts and to the crank.\n",

They are normally mounted on the front or behind a cyclist’s seat and not on the side like trailers.  In both cases, however, the child will always be facing towards the front.  The average age for putting your child in such a seat ranges from 1-5 years old.  Having a child bike seat at the front is always a given plus.  One of the biggest benefits is that the child is surrounded by your protective arms and should they need any attending to, it does not take much for them to capture your attention.\n",

Marvel’s recent popularity seems to be caused by its crazy flood of recent movies, which is going to make them seem more popular because they have more viewers in a given time frame, even if they were to get the same amount, or less, viewers per movie when compared to DC ones.  Meanwhile, DC has been going crazy with TV shows for ages, and many of them are pretty popular, while Marvel seems to have only recently gotten into this area.  This, of course, does not in itself make DC better, but the fact that they have had so many popular TV shows at all says something about their storytelling and animation.  It also helps that DC hasn’t had to worry about copyright issues when creating their TV shows and movies, which is something that has limited Marvel quite a bit.\n",

Side 2: Although DC has made a few great movies, usually involving Batman, they can’t hold a candle compared to the list of hits Marvel has put out.  We need to remember the 2002 Sam Raimi Spiderman films were huge contributors to the current superhero movie phenomenon.  I worked in a movie theater for a few years, and I asked the owners what their busiest movie was; they told me when the original Spiderman movie came out they had a line out the door and wrapping around the parking lot.  Marvel has managed to make something that was once either purely children’s entertainment or the hobby for nerds into a mainstream sensation.  As far as TV shows are concerned, DC may have more live action dramas than Marvel, but I’d bet way more people will recognize an animated Spiderman or Hulk than the live action Arrow stars.  To put it simply, Marvel just has a way better image than DC.  Even their worst movies are better than Batman vs Superman.  Round 2 Side 1: To say that Marvel has the most recognizable characters is a bit simplistic.\n",

                            "text": "\nYes, maybe more people would recognize Spiderman before they would recognize the Green Arrow, but that same argument could be reversed. More people are likely to know who Superman is than they would know Hawkeye.  Plus, it’s a common belief that Superman is the original superhero in terms of defining what a superhero is.  If that’s not a point in DC’s favor, I don’t know what is.  Also, in terms of villains, whose are the most well known?  DC’s villains.  The Joker, Harley Quinn, The Riddler, all of these are names that most kids grew up hearing, while, until recently, Marvel’s villains were not quite as infamous.  Why would they be so well known if they weren’t great villains?  In this area, DC has done much better for far longer than Marvel has.  Marvel may be the current fad, but the question of who will remain superior is something that only time will show, and that is something DC has been pretty good at keeping up with.  Side 2: Marvel didn’t just change how modern cinema portrays comic heroes.  They revolutionized modern television writing in general.  Marvel was a pioneer of crafting connected worlds that impact each other, something DC is trying to catch up to.\n",

The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from a screenplay by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.  It stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America alongside Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell, Robert Redford, and Samuel L. Jackson.  In the film, Captain America joins forces with Black Widow and Falcon to uncover a conspiracy within the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. while facing a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier .  Markus and McFeely began writing the sequel around the release of The First Avenger in July 2011.  The script draws from the Winter Soldier story arc in the comic books written by Ed Brubaker as well as conspiracy fiction from the 1970s such as Three Days of the Condor (1975).  The film explores S.H.I.E.L.D., similarly to how the first film explored the U.S. military, after Rogers was shown working for the agency in the MCU crossover film The Avengers (2012).  The Russo brothers signed to direct in June 2012 and casting began the following month.\n",

But even with Oscar nominee Edward Norton in a one-shot turn as Bruce Banner (which Oscar nominee Mark Ruffalo would inherit for the rest of his MCU appearances), there’s still some relevance to fully appreciating the long arc toward “Endgame.”  For one, this is where we meet Gen. Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt), who briefly turns up in “Endgame.”  And in a post-credits scene, Tony Stark himself approaches the General, cryptically proposing the assemblage of a “team.”\n",

Taken as a whole, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is an undeniable achievement in cinema.  It began with a simple idea, thrown in after the credits of the first, risky movie: “You've become part of a bigger universe.  You just don't know it yet.”  That idea blossomed into movies that crossed over with each other, sometimes with incredible results and other times with diminished returns.  I decided to look back at the films in the universe and rank them from worst to best.  You will likely disagree with my rankings.  23) Iron Man 2 Image via Paramount Pictures If Nick Fury’s words to Tony Stark at the end of Iron Man were a confident declaration about the intentions to create the “Avengers Initiative”, then Iron Man 2 is tripping over your shoelaces and faceplanting.  Iron Man 2 suffers from trying to do too much in the span of one movie, and no one seeming to agree on what needs to take priority.\n",

While Mickey Rourke definitely had some clout coming off The Wrestler, director Jon Favreau just got a campy performance out of the actor, who clearly thinks the material is beneath him, as opposed to Darren Aronofsky, who got the best performance of Rourke’s career.  This is to say nothing about Tony’s palladium poisoning and how it just so happens that his dad invented the one thing that could save his son’s life, built it decades before his son miniaturized it, and then hid the plans in a table.  It makes you wonder if Howard Stark put any other revolutionary ideas in furniture.\n",

He’s not caught up in Avengers business, he’s pretty much making fun of Rourke’s lackadaisical performance, and he gets to look good doing everything.  But when an actor who doesn’t even get top billing is the one who steals the movie, something has gone amiss.  22)  Doctor Strange Image via Marvel Doctor Strange is a weird beast.  It feels cobbled together in a way that it goes by the familiar beats of previous Marvel movies--notably Iron Man and Guardians of the Galaxy --but it also feels rote and uninteresting despite the trappings of putting its protagonist into a magical world.  It seems like Marvel stuck close to a familiar playbook because they knew they were making a bit of a leap with \"magic\", but when it came time to make that magic, it was fairly uninteresting.  I understand the difficulty Strange presents with magic because magic needs rules or else everything falls apart.  That being said, the film leans far too heavily on the \"cocky guy becomes a nicer guy\" story Marvel has done before, and does so in a largely uninteresting way.\n",

Every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie, Ranked From Worst to Best From Iron Man to Avengers: Endgame, we rank every entry into the multi-billion dollar franchise.  By Matt Miller Jul 3, 2019 Marvel In the mid-2000s Marvel was in trouble.  Comics were a thing of the past and superhero movies were at a crossroads.  Rights were scattered across a number of different studios making it difficult to wrangle any of these heroes into a single franchise.  Then Marvel Studios had the crazy idea to attempt to bring some of what were then considered B-list heroes under one roof to launch a new cinematic universe.  It was unprecedented and no one thought it would work—especially by anchoring this massive undertaking with a nobody like Iron Man.  But, the Robert Downey Jr.-starring film was a hit, and history was made.\n",

And though at this point the Disney property has crafted a reliable superhero movie formula, not all of the MCU movies are created equal.  Here they are ranked from worst to best.

DeKnight considers Goddard a “phenomenal writer and fantastic director,” and considers Goddard an even bigger fan of Daredevil than DeKnight was.  Then Goddard was whisked away by Spider-Man’s Hollywood web.  Goddard was linked to work on a Spider-Man spinoff “The Sinister Six,” but when Marvel Studios announced that it had made a deal with Sony to share the rights to Spider-Man, Goddard suddenly became even busier — and he is rumored to be the man to revive the once-dominant franchise under the guidance of Marvel Studios.  At that point, DeKnight received a phone call from his agent: “Daredevil” suddenly needed a producer.\n",

But DeKnight says “Daredevil” already having secured the rights to film in New York was a major factor in him coming aboard the project.  “Much to Marvel’s credit, they really wanted [  Daredevil] to be shot in their hometown,” DeNight said.  “The heads of Marvel are all in New York, and they really felt like the city needed to be another character in the series — and I totally agreed.  I don’t think this show would be as successful without having shot in New York.  It’s a feeling and a look, that you just can’t replicate anywhere else.”  The city’s shadows would serve as a concrete sidekick to DeKnight’s urban vigilante.

Many claim it’s a recent hot topic, a push from fans and critics alike to portray individuals who aren’t simply white.  There are some who argue — and in minor instances they may be right — that inclusion is simply a cash grab.  But really, it’s hard to argue that representing the world at large is anything but a good thing.  The Earth’s population is so much more than what you see than on shows like Friends and House of Cards.  But why is there a push back?  Why do some claim inclusion is a bad thing?  A Complicated Diverse History in Comics This is a loaded question, so it’s best to narrow it down to one medium: comic books.  Comic books have quite an interesting history with diversity, and the perspective you choose to look through will also give you different results.  Generally speaking, there are many who will rightfully say the history of comics, particularly Marvel and DC, are very whitewashed.\n",

The X-Men: The Original Diverse Comics Team But then there is another viewpoint that must not be forgotten.  Diversity has a niche in comics, particularly with the X-Men.  Known for being a representation for minorities, the X-Men have been the catalyst for diversity in Marvel since their conception.  The 1975 team in Giant Size X-Men #1 debuted a plethora of diverse characters, and the 1982 New Mutants gave us even more variety with characters like Sunspot, Mirage, and Karma.  While this was only a small faction of Marvel, these were arguably some of the most interesting books by Marvel at the time.  Writer Chris Claremont introduced and utilized diversity in such a natural way, a lesson quite a few outlets should pay attention to today.  Of course these two titles weren’t perfect in representation.  They were a bit stereotypical at times, and the creators of New Mutants — Chris Claremont and Bob McLeod — are white males themselves.\n",

While Chris Claremont was progressive for his era, the experiences he was depicting in the lives of characters like Warpath and Mirage (who are Native Americans) were not authentic.  In the ComicsVerse podcast Episode 68: Marvel’s NEW MUTANTS, the team notes the importance to “start a conversation about these cultures and talk about mainstreaming and talk about why there aren’t as many brown and black artists.”  The cast of this podcast go on to discuss the dichotomy of white artists representing other cultures and people of color representing their own culture.  While the X-Men and New Mutants were groundbreaking for their time, some of the heroes do tiptoe around being token characters.

Pine hung his head.  “See? See?  I knew that was going to happen,” Pine said, wagging his finger.  “I am not in Guardians of the Galaxy.  That’s Chris Pratt.  I am Chris Pine.”  Pine proceeded to bring SNL cast members on stage to clarify his identity, but they only confuse him with other famous Chrises.  Pine is forced to tell Leslie Jones that he is neither Chris Evans, who played Captain America, nor Chris Hemsworth.  Jones snaps a selfie, then yells “Thank you, Thor!”  Before Pine can correct her again — it was Hemsworth who starred in “Thor” — she disappears from the stage.  If the set up seemed familiar, it’s because the many Chrises phenomenon has been around in Hollywood for several years now.\n",

They didn’t want female characters out there,” Gabriel said at the Marvel Retailer Summit, according to Entertainment Weekly.  “We saw the sales of any character that was diverse, any character that was new, our female characters, anything that was not a core Marvel character, people were turning their nose up against.  That was difficult for us because we had a lot of fresh, new, exciting ideas that we were trying to get out and nothing new really worked.”  Online, readers slammed Marvel for changing old characters rather than coming up with new ones — or reintroducing old ones — that reflected their communities.\n",

Ultimately, it comes down to choosing the one that will compensate each individual technician according to his or her ability.  Advertisement By Lee Amaradio Jr on October 1, 2007 Writer Lee Amaradio Jr. is the president and founder of Faith Quality Auto Body Inc. in Murrieta, Calif.  His 32,000-square-foot state-of-the-art facility employs 65 full-time employees and does $7 million in gross sales.  In business since 1979, Lee attributes his success to having a great team of quality people supporting him.  Lee says that he â€œsees the handwriting on the wallâ€ and believes that â€œnow is the time for us to reclaim our industry, before itâ€™s too late.â€ Advertisement Click Here to Read More Advertisement Some collision repair shops debate about whether paying their technicians a salary or paying them a commission is the best compensation method.  I know what we prefer to use, and it comes from a lot of hard lessons learned over the last 28 years.  We’ve used both methods of pay and have achieved an equal number of successes and failures with each one.  There’s a fine line between paying a tech what he’s worth and making a profit.\n",

If you’re small and busy, I recommend paying by salary because, due to your size, you can monitor each tech closely.  You don’t have to rely as much on the tech creating supplements by finding things he would usually want to get paid for.  If you’re small and not continuously busy, I recommend having commissioned employees only.\n",

When we finally became busy again, no one was motivated except me.  I thought everyone would work harder to help us make up for our losses, but I was dead wrong.  Somehow, the slow period caused everyone to become lazy, and when we found ourselves busy again, I couldn’t get anyone to produce even close to what they had produced before.  Everyone acted like I was asking them for something extra because I expected them to work all of a sudden, and this gave my employees a bad attitude.  Advertisement My next decision was a desperate one.  I told everyone that I was going to either reduce their salaries by 10 percent or move them to commission.  To my surprise, everyone chose commission!  They all thought they were producing far above what I was paying them.  And that’s one of the problems with salary – most employees will only remember the weeks when they produced, but will forget the weeks when they hardly accomplished anything at all.\n",

How to Answer Example Answer Admin Example Manager Example Marketing Example Retail Example Sales Example Teacher Example Community Answers The interviewer wants to know that you have put effort into getting to know the role, researching their company and that you see this opportunity as a suitable match.  Recruiters and hiring managers often receive hundreds of applications per job.  If you are lucky enough to land an interview, put significant effort into researching the opportunity.  Take the time to uncover why you are genuinely excited about the opportunity.  While your passion and excitement for the job are essential, it's always good to have some hard facts prepared.  For instance, saying 'I have heard great things about your company, and I know I would be an excellent fit for this job,' is not very specific.  Instead, try to find recent news or releases related to the company's accomplishments.  Mention specifically how those accomplishments made an impression on you.  Be sure to close your statement with an expression of pure enthusiasm.\n",

There’s a huge range of different courses that you can do, and many types of qualifications you can get, from entry level to advanced.  The length of the course depends on what level you study at.  Why should I study a vocational subject?  Vocational qualifications are a good option if you have a clear idea of what type of career or trade you’d like to work in.  They can help you to get the specific skills you need to get your first job or progress further in your career.  However, if you’re not sure yet what you want to do, you could find many (but not all) of the courses quite limiting, something we’ll explore further in this article.

We’re pleased today to be able to kick off our newest Washington Post Live event series tied to our Technology 202 newsletter.  It’s going to launch in early December, anchored by Washington Post reporter Cat Zakrzewski.  The Technology 202 will focus on the intersection of Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley, including the challenges that government officials face in keeping pace with new technologies, which will be the focus of this morning’s session.  Our speakers today include the chief executive of one of the world’s largest e-commerce companies, three of President Trump’s key technology policy advisors, a member of Congress representing Silicon Valley, and several other thought leaders from government and technology communities.  They’ll be discussing the major policy and regulatory issues that will affect how technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing will evolve in the United States, and how American companies can compete globally while protecting the interests of our consumers.  Before we begin, I would like to thank our presenting sponsor for this series, Siemens.  And later this morning, we’ll have the pleasure of hearing from the CEO.  I’d also like thank our supporting sponsor, the University of Virginia.\n",

There is no distinction anymore between e-commerce and commerce.  You’re seeing it break down every day.  If I go into a store and scan something and walk out and buy it, is that commerce or e-commerce?  Or if I buy something online and pick it up in a store?  The lines have fully blurred.

We want to be always a place that is a unique and fun and interesting shopping experience, but also very useful.  And a place where people can count and rely on.

In the course of doing the projects you’re exposed to a wide swatch of the Android universe.  None of the projects are trivial, the latter ones are quite complex.  Your project has to fill all the squares in a requirements matrix that they call a ‘rubric’.  When you think you are done you submit your project for code review, and in return you get a line by line review of your code.  If you don’t meet all the project requirements it’s no harm, no foul, you just have to keep working until you do.\n",

I’ve done a lot interviewing in my career, and I’d certainly give a lot of weight to a Nanodegree holder.  Certainly it would be enlightening to look the candidate’s Github and see how he codes real applications.  One major caveat!  This course is laser focused on developing Android applications.  It assumes you are familiar with Java programming.  It assumes you are familiar with basic computer science concepts such as data structures, algorithms, basic tcp/ip networking, sql, etc.  The Android Nanodegree is not for persons lacking basic computer programming training.

A few weeks ago a Dutch friend of mine introduced me to Ecosia, the Berlin-based social enterprise eco search engine that uses their profits to plant trees (that’s a mouthful).  The idea immediately clicked with me for a few reasons I’ll discuss below.  Ecosia has a model that’s ripe to explode with a millennial generation that truly does care about how sustainable their products are.  Unfortunately projects that set out to do great for the world often receive criticism, and the Ecosia search engine won’t be immune.  There were two major things that I wanted to learn about Ecosia: Is Ecosia legit?  Or is it a scam?  Does it work as well as Google?  Let’s make legitimacy the first thing we look at in this Ecosia critique because that’s the most important part.  Is Ecosia legit or a scam?\n",

In 2019 Ecosia claims to have surpassed 65 million trees planted.  While this is well shy of the ~1.5 trillion trees that experts say are needed to offset the carbon we’ve added to the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution, it’s still nothing to laugh at.  Ecosia after all is still a pretty small company with roughly 8 million users (although this is growing really fast).  As far as the misleading search results or collecting data go, this isn’t really something we can test.  But given the track record of the team at Ecosia I’m pretty confident they aren’t out to scam people.  Ecosia does however get criticism from a few sites online, including an article from 2Spyware claiming that Ecosia is a browser-hijacker, and borderline virus.\n",

But they do it in no way different than when Google places ads in your search results, Google just dishes out the profits to their investors instead of planting trees.  They even go as far as to say “getting rid of the Ecosia virus”, which is just absurd to me.  I have a feeling this article was written by someone who hasn’t ever used Ecosia and was directed to write about Ecosia being a virus to get the search traffic.  While I do think those accusations against Ecosia aren’t based on rationality, I also have to acknowledge that they could be true, just like Google could be a virus.  My advice is to check out the Ecosia team and see if these are folks you’re willing to trust with your online data.  Personally, I’m not concerned about an ecosia.org virus.  Is Ecosia fake?  Quite a few people have written in and asked if Ecosia is downright fake.\n",

To properly understand how search queries are served, you need to have a basic understanding of how search engines work.  Please look it up as I do not want to dive into the details here.  However, the takeaway is that the bigger, richer companies, such as google, have the equipment and technology to better collect in the moment up to date information from sources.  For example, google may “scrape” a site like the NY Times many times a day, whereas smaller companies may only be able to do this once a day.  The grey area lies when entering a query for a news article, right leaning publication results lie way down the screen, and sometimes not at all.  For example, when searching for an article on Breitbart, using google, you generally have to specify the publication, rather than only the headline.  Smaller companies, like DDG are now using over 400 sources to serve better results, and overall the results seem better balanced.  Hard to prove, as the search engine is only serving what it is given, and what it is given is sourced from a majority of left leaning companies.\n",

More comprehensive regulation is needed as emerging technologies become increasingly advanced and opaque.  As algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world.  Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise, and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes.  Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design.  Algorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech.  It has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, economic, and gender biases.  The relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets.\n",

Noble was looking for websites to share with her stepdaughter and nieces.  She searched \"black girls\" on Google, expecting to be directed to educational sites, historical information, or pop culture sites for young people.  Instead, the first hit was the site HotBlackPussy.com.  The first page was filled with similar results.  According to Google in 2010, \"black girls\" were defined not by history, interests, or aspirations.  They were defined as porn.  What accounts for such racist, sexist search results?  Most people tend to attribute Google failures or glitches like this to public search patterns; search engines return porn for \"black girls\" because those are the sites that people click on most.\n",

Search algorithms are created by people and reflect, not just the racist and sexist biases of users, but the racist and sexist biases of their designers.  \"It’s insufficient to declare search results to be simply a matter of what users do online,\" Noble told me by email.  \"Certainly that is part of it, but more importantly, Google is an advertising platform and its customers or advertisers are looking to optimize their content, products, and services.

For example, searching for information about Jewish people or history often leads to anti-Semitic websites.  In late 2016, the Guardian's Carole Cadwalladr tried to search for information about the Holocaust.  The top result for the question \"Did the Holocaust happen?\" was the Nazi site Stormfront.  Cadwalladr concluded that Google was prioritizing popular results rather than more reliable ones such as Wikipedia, because organizing searches by popularity is appealing to Google's advertisers.  Google's stranglehold on information, and the public's assumption that Google information is reliable and neutral, can cause concrete harm.  There is evidence that accounts connected to the Russian government bought ads on Google related to the 2016 election, for example.\n",

A market research class I took in graduate school focused on the identification and elimination of bias.  My final paper was on an intentionally biased piece of research.  It was far easier to introduce bias and then talk about the bias than it would have been to attempt to do unbiased work and defend it as unbiased.  For that reason alone, the Trump administration's recent complaints that Google's search engine is biased are almost certainly true.  The nature of the bias, however, has not been determined.  It actually could be bias in favor of Trump (though the odds are against that because Google was so tight with the Obama administration and liberals in general).  The perception of bias simply may be driven by the overwhelming amount of negative ink on the administration and a revenue-focused algorithm that pushes people to that volume.  I'll share some thoughts on bias and then close with my product of the week: The Lenovo Yoga Book C930, announced at IFA last week, is one of the most innovative laptop/tablet products on the market.

In reality, Ford's quality is in line with other similar car makers -- and often better, depending on the line.  So, even if the best car for you might be a Ford, I've excluded all Fords from consideration due to my bias.  My advice would be suboptimal at best.  At worst it could influence you to make a truly bad decision.  One of the most obvious places we see bias play out is in relationships.  When we go into a relationship it is often with a bias toward our partner.  We see the good, not the bad, which is due in part to the fact that in a new relationship people are initially on their best behavior.\n",

Both perceptions likely are biased.  During the good times, the partner wasn't all good, and when the relationship failed, the partner wasn't all bad.  One of the ways to ensure better relationships is to do your homework on potential partners up front, before you become invested.  What were their past relationships like?  What are they looking for in a new relationship?  Are they honest and transparent?  Can you tolerate their family?  Are your most important views, values and goals aligned?  More typically, people are interested in whether prospective partners are hot or financially secure.  Though these are factors to consider, they shouldn't override the others.  Assuming that success is either a long relationship, marriage, or at least a lasting friendship, then doing the honest assessment up front should get you closer to a good match.

Before they had a firm understanding of search engine optimization (SEO), they were running an Etsy store that sold high-quality, custom-engraved gifts, but they weren’t maximizing their traffic — and by extension, their revenue.  However, once they understood Etsy search and the power of keywords — particularly how to utilize long tail keywords — everything changed.  “Once I figured out what people wanted, I would target longer-tail keywords and all of a sudden, sales started coming in,” Kirk said in an interview with Marmalead.  Etsy SEO is the process of improving the visibility of your shop and its products in search engines like Google, as well as within Etsy’s own search function.  SEO can be challenging, especially since search engines are constantly changing the way they search, but it’s important for Etsy sellers to have a basic understanding of SEO best practices, so they can optimize their shops for search and get their items in front of more potential buyers.

How Etsy search works Etsy’s search tool is designed to provide shoppers with items they’re looking for, and there are two phases to how it works: query matching and ranking.  These are complex factors, but understanding them will help you learn how they can be influenced, allowing you to drive more visitors to your shop.  Query matching is simply how well a user’s search term matches Etsy’s inventory listings.  When a shopper enters a search term, Etsy sorts through listings’ titles, tags, categories, and attributes to find the best match.  Then, to determine the listings’ rankings in search results, Etsy uses information about each listing and shop to display items that shoppers are most likely to purchase earlier in the results.  The factors Etsy uses for search ranking include the following: Relevancy: When tags, titles, categories, and attributes match a user’s search term, listings have the potential to appear in search results.  Keywords that are an exact match appear higher.  Listing quality score: This essentially means how well a listing converts.\n",

Recency: How recently the item listing was created.  When a new listing is created, Etsy temporarily boosts it in the search results to help determine the listing’s quality score.  Customer and market experience score: Each shop has a score — based on customer reviews, how complete your shop’s About section is, and any negative feedback — which affects its ranking.  Shipping price: Because shipping price factors heavily into a user’s decision to purchase, Etsy gives priority search placement to stores that ship for free or shops that offer a free-shipping guarantee to shoppers in the U.S. Translations and language: All shop information, including individual listings’ titles and tags, must be in the language you selected when you created your Etsy account.  Shop location: In the EU, Australia, and Canada, the seller’s location is taken into account, and local items are slightly more prominent in search results.  Location isn’t a factor in searches done within other countries.  Shoppers’ habits: Search results are also customized for individual shoppers.\n",

The problem that conservatives have to deal with is that one really good non-ideological signal to use is in ranking results whether or not a given site knowingly publishes falsehood.  Generally speaking, users want the content that appears in their search results to have a strong likelihood of being factual.  What conservatives think they want is a search engine that doesn’t downgrade results if they come from sites whose veracity is questionable.  But that will make the search engine much less useful for everyone - even conservatives.  I think a lot of conservatives also want a search engine that doesn’t downgrade sites that talk openly about how the kikes are running everything.  The great majority of users get pretty upset when they see stuff like that in their search results, which is why search engines tend to downgrade pages that contain that sort of language.  But you don’t need a conservative search engine to get those results if you like.  The pages are still indexed.\n",

Anyway, if you want a search engine that is ideologically pure, one already exists: it’s called Baidu, and it does a stellar job at emphasizing the things that the ruling party wants to emphasize.  It’s also very successful even though in areas it’s really not very useful at all, at the small cost of being under the complete control of the state.  Update: I should add, for the benefit of those looking for such a thing, that Google functions quite well as a conservative search engine, if you provide it with the right search terms.  Look up “the collusion hoax,” for instance.  You’ll find a whole lot of hits from conservative media (with Fox and the WSJ topping the list), and CNN way at the bottom of the first page, below Dan Bongino’s podcast.  There’s a strategy among conservative politicians in the US to use certain terms in their discourse that aren’t being used by their political opposition.  If you search for those terms, all you’ll find is conservative opinion, because there’s no other opinion around for Google to index.\n",
