# TREC CAsT Tools

This repository contains useful tools/scripts to help with the TREC CAsT Track.

The repository is organised as follows:

- `corpus processing`: Scripts to process the CAsT 2022 document collection and generate canonical passage splits
- `mi_pool_generation`: Scripts to generate the mixed initiative question pool for CAsT 2022
- `run_validation`: Scripts to validate run files for CAsT 2022

This repository has been reorganised recently, with lots of old code removed. 

Code for previous years can be found starting from this commit [59a6e7220bc](https://github.com/grill-lab/trec-cast-tools/tree/59a6e7220bcecb60ebfb12a1ba0365f2bbf1db27) in the git history.
