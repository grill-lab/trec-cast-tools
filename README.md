# TREC CAsT Tools

This repository contains useful tools/scripts to help with the TREC CAsT Track.

The repository is organised as follows:

- `corpus processing`: Scripts to process the CAsT 2022 document collection and generate canonical passage splits
- `mi_pool_generation`: Scripts to generate the mixed initiative question pool for CAsT 2022
- `run_validation`: Scripts to validate run files for CAsT 2022

This repository has been reorganised recently, with lots of old code moved to the archive folder.
